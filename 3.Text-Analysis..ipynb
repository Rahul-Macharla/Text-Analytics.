       "array('    one of the other reviewer have mention that after watch just oz episode youll be hook they be right a this be exactly what happen with me the first thing that strike me about oz be it utality and unflinching scene of violence which set in right from the word go trust me this be not a show for the faint hearted or timid this show pull no punch with regard to drug sex or violence it be hardcore in the classic use of the word it be call oz a that be the nickname give to the oswald maximum security state penitentary it focus mainly on emerald city an experimental section of the prison where all the cell have glass front and face inwards so privacy be not high on the agenda em city be home to many  aryans muslim gangstas latinos christian italian irish and more      so scuffle death stare dodgy dealing and shady agreement be never far away i would say the main appeal of the show be due to the fact that it go where other show wouldnt dare forget pretty picture paint for mainstream audience forget charm forget romance     oz doesnt mess around the first episode i ever saw strike me a so nasty it be surreal i couldnt say i be ready for it but a i watch more i develop a taste for oz and get accustom to the high level of graphic violence not just violence but injustice crook guard wholl be sell out for a nickel inmates wholl kill on order and get away with it well mannered middle class inmate be turn into prison bitch due to their lack of street skill or prison experience watch oz you may become comfortable with what be uncomfortable view      thats if you can get in touch with your darker side  n  a wonderful little production the filming technique be very unassuming very oldtimebbc fashion and give a comforting and sometimes discomforting sense of realism to the entire piece the actor be extremely well choose michael sheen not only have get all the polari but he have all the voice down pat too you can truly see the seamless edit guide by the reference to williams diary entry not only be it well worth the watching but it be a terrificly write and perform piece a masterful production about one of the great master of comedy and his life the realism really come home with the little thing the fantasy of the guard which rather than use the traditional dream technique remain solid then disappear it play on our knowledge and our sens particularly with the scene concern orton and halliwell and the set particularly of their flat with halliwells mural decorate every surface be terribly well do  n  i think this be a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend sit in the air condition theater and watch a lighthearted comedy the plot be simplistic but the dialogue be witty and the character be likable even the well ead suspect serial killer while some may be disappoint when they realize this be not match point risk addiction i think it be proof that woody allen be still fully in control of the style many of u have grow to love this be the most id laugh at one of woodys comedy in year dare i say a decade while ive never be impress with scarlet johanson in this she manage to tone down her sexy image and jump right into a average but spirited young woman this may not be the crown jewel of his career but it be witty than devil wear prada and more interesting than superman a great comedy to go see with friend  n  basically theres a family where a little boy jake think theres a zombie in his closet his parent be fight all the time this movie be slow than a soap opera     and suddenly jake decides to become rambo and kill the zombie ok first of all when youre go to make a film you must decide if it a thriller or a drama a a drama the movie be watchable parent be divorce argue like in real life and then we have jake with his closet which totally ruin all the film i expect to see a boogeyman similar movie and instead i watch a drama with some meaningless thriller spot out of just for the well play parent descent dialog a for the shot with jake just ignore them  n  petter matteis love in the time of money be a visually stunning film to watch mr  mattei offer u a vivid portrait about human relation this be a movie that seem to be tell u what money power and success do to people in the different situation we encounter this be a variation on the arthur schnitzlers play about the same theme the director transfer the action to the present time new york where all these different character meet and connect each one be connect in one way or another to the next person but no one seem to know the previous point of contact stylishly the film have a sophisticated luxurious look we be take to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat the only thing one get out of all these soul in the picture be the different stage of loneliness each one inhabit a big city be not exactly the best place in which human relation find sincere fulfillment a one discerns be the case with most of the people we encounter the act be good under mr  matteis direction steve buscemi rosario dawson carol kane michael imperioli adrian grenier and the rest of the talented cast make these character come alive we wish mr  mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work  n  probably my alltime favorite movie a story of selflessness sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause but it not preachy or bore it just never get old despite my have see it some or more time in the last year paul lukas performance ings tear to my eye and bette davis in one of her very few truly sympathetic role be a delight the kid be a grandma say more like dressedup midget than child but that only make them more fun to watch and the mother slow awaken to whats happen in the world and under her own roof be believable and startle if i have a dozen thumb theyd all be up for this movie  n  i sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated seahunt series with the tech they have today it would ing back the kid excitement in me i grow up on black and white tv and seahunt with gunsmoke be my heros every week you have my vote for a comeback of a new sea hunt we need a change of pace in tv and this would work for a world of under water adventure oh by the way thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoint about tv and the many movies so any ole way i believe ive get what i wan na say would be nice to read some more plus point about sea hunt if my rhyme would be line would you let me submitor leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quitif this be so then i must go so lets do it  n  this show be an amazing fresh innovative idea in the s when it first air the first or year be illiant but thing drop off after that by the show be not really funny anymore and it continue it decline far to the complete waste of time it be today its truly disgraceful how far this show have fall the writing be painfully bad the performance be almost a bad if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guesthosts this show probably wouldnt still be on the air i find it so hard to believe that the same creator that handselected the original cast also choose the band of hack that follow how can one recognize such illiance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity i felt i must give star out of respect for the original cast that make this show such a huge success a it be now the show be just awful i cant believe it still on the air  n  encourage by the positive comment about this film on here i be look forward to watch this film bad mistake ive see film and this be truly one of the bad of them it awful in almost every way edit pace storyline act soundtrack the film only song a lame country tune be play no less than four time the film look cheap and nasty and be bore in the extreme rarely have i be so happy to see the end credit of a film the only thing that prevent me give this a score be harvey keitel while this be far from his best performance he at least seem to be make a bit of an effort one for keitel obsessive only  n  if you like original gut wrench laughter you will like this movie if you be young or old then you will love this movie hell even my mom like it great camp  n  phil the alien be one of those quirky film where the humour be base around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlines at first it be very odd and pretty funny but a the movie progress i didnt find the joke or oddness funny anymore its a low budget film thats never a problem in itself there be some pretty interesting character but eventually i just lose interest i imagine this film would appeal to a stoner who be currently partaking for something similar but good try brother from another planet  n  i saw this movie when i be about when it come out i recall the scary scene be the big bird eat men dangle helplessly from parachute right out of the air the horror the horror as a young kid go to these cheesy b film on saturday afternoon i still be tire of the formula for these monster type movie that usually include the hero a beautiful woman who might be the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution when the monster die in the end i didnt care much for the romantic angle a a year old and the predictable plot i love them now for the unintentional humor but about a year or so later i saw psycho when it come out and i love that the star janet leigh be bump off early in the film i sit up and take notice at that point since screenwriter be make up the story make it up to be as scary a possible and not from a wellworn formula there be no rule  n  so im not a big fan of boll work but then again not many be i enjoy his movie postal maybe im the only one boll apparently buy the right to use far cry long ago even before the game itself be even finsished people who have enjoy kill mercs and infiltrate secret research lab locate on a tropical island should be warn that this be not far cry     this be something mr boll have scheme together along with his legion of schmucks   feel loneley on the set mr boll invite three of his countryman to play with these player go by the name of til schweiger udo kier and ralf moeller three name that actually have make them selfs pretty big in the movie biz so the tale go like this jack carver play by til schweiger yes carver be german all hail the atwurst eating dude however i find that tils act in this movie be pretty badass   people have complain about how he not really stay true to the whole carver agenda but we only saw carver in a first person perspective so we dont really know what he look like when he be kick a     however the storyline in this film be beyond demented we see the evil mad scientist dr  krieger play by udo kier make geneticallymutatedsoldiers or gm a they be call perform his topsecret research on an island that remind me of spoiler vancouver for some reason thats right no palm tree here instead we get some nice rich lumberjackwoods we havent even go far before i start to cry mehehe i can not go on any more   if you wan na stay true to boll shenanigan then go and see this movie you will not be disappoint it deliver the true boll experience mean most of it will suck there be some thing worth mention that would imply that boll do a good work on some area of the film such a some nice boat and fight scene until the whole cromed albino gm squad enter the scene and everything just make me laugh   the movie far cry reek of scheisse thats poop for you simpleton from a far if you wan na take a wiff go ahead   btw carver get a very annoying sidekick who make you wan na shoot him the first three minute he on screen  n  the cast play shakespeare shakespeare lost i appreciate that this be try to ing shakespeare to the mass but why ruin something so good is it because the scottish play be my favorite shakespeare i do not know what i do know be that a certain rev bowdler hence bowdlerization try to do something similar in the victorian era in other word you can not improve perfection i have no more to write but a i have to write at least ten line of text and english composition be never my forte i will just have to keep go and say that this movie a the say go just do not cut it  n  this a fantastic movie of three prisoner who become famous one of the actor be george clooney and im not a fan but this roll be not bad another good thing about the movie be the soundtrack the man of constant sorrow i recommand this movie to everybody greeting bart  n  kind of drawn in by the erotic scene only to realize this be one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bit of film ive ever see sort of like a high school film project what be rosanna arquette thinking and what be with all those stock character in that bizarre suppose midwest town pretty hard to get involve with this one no lesson to be learn from it no illiant insight just stilted and quite ridiculous but lot of skin if that intrigue you videotape nonsense      what be with the bisexual relationship out of nowhere after all the heterosexual encounter and what be with that absurd dance with everybody play their stereotyped role give this one a pas it like a million other mile of bad waste film money that could have be spend on starve child or aid in africa         n  some film just simply should not be remake this be one of them in and of itself it be not a bad film but it fail to capture the flavor and the terror of the film of the same title liam neeson be excellent a he always be and most of the cast hold up with the exception of owen wilson who just do not ing the right feel to the character of luke but the major fault with this version be that it stray too far from the shirley jackson story in it attempt to be grandiose and lose some of the thrill of the early film in a trade off for snazzy special effect again i will say that in and of itself it be not a bad film but you will enjoy the friction of terror in the old version much more  n  this movie make it into one of my top most awful movie horrible there wasnt a continuous minute where there wasnt a fight with one monster or another there be no chance for any character development they be too busy run from one sword fight to another i have no emotional attachment except to the big bad machine that want to destroy them scene be blatantly steal from other movie lotr star war and matrix examples the ghost scene at the end be steal from the final scene of the old star war with yoda obee one and vader the spider machine in the beginning be exactly like frodo be attack by the spider in return of the king elijah wood be the victim in both film and wait         it hypnotize sting it victim and wrap them up       uh hello and the whole machine vs  human theme be the matrix  or terminator       there be more example but why waste the time and will someone tell me what be with the nazis nazi there be a juvenile story line rush to a juvenile conclusion the movie could not decide if it be a childrens movie or an adult movie and wasnt much of either just awful a real disappointment to say the least save your money  n  i remember this filmit be the first film i have watch at the cinema the picture be dark in place i be very nervous it be back in my dad take me my other sister to newbury cinema in newbury berkshire england i recall the tiger and the lot of snow in the film also the appearance of grizzly adam actor dan haggery i think one of the tiger get shot and die if anyone know where to find this on dvd etc please let me know the cinema now have be turn in a fitness club which be a very big shame a the near cinema now be mile away would love to hear from others who have see this film or any other like it  n  an awful film it must have be up against some real stinker to be nominate for the golden globe theyve take the story of the first famous female renaissance painter and mangle it beyond recognition my complaint be not that theyve take liberty with the fact if the story be good that would perfectly fine but it simply bizarre by all account the true story of this artist would have make for a far good film so why do they come up with this dishwaterdull script i suppose there werent enough naked people in the factual version it hurriedly cap off in the end with a summary of the artist life we could have save ourselves a couple of hour if theyd favor the rest of the film with same evity  n  after the success of die hard and it sequel it no surprise really that in the s a glut of die hard on a        movie cash in on the wrong guy wrong place wrong time concept that be what they do with cliffhanger die hard on a mountain just in time to rescue sly stop or my mom will shoot stallones career cliffhanger be one big nitpicker dream especially to those who be expert at mountain climb basejumping aviation facial expression act skill all in all it full of excuse to dismiss the film a one overblown pile of junk stallone even manage to get outacted by a horse however if you an forget all the nonsense it actually a very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that deliver a plenty of thrill and unintentionally plenty of laughs youve get to love john lithgows sneery evilness his tick every box band of baddie and best of all the permanently harass and hapless turncoat agent rex linn a travers he may of be henry in portrait of a serial killer but michael rooker be noteworthy for a cringeworthy performance a hal he insist on constantly shriek in painful disbelief at his captor that man never hurt anybody and whilst he surely cant be it really do look like ralph waite frank character be grin a the girl plummet to her death mention too must go to former london burn actor craig fairass a the brit bad guy who come a cropper whilst use hal a a human football yes you cant help enjoy that bit hal need a good kicking so forget your good judgement who care if that could never happen low your acting expectation turn up the volume and enjoy and if youre look for qaulen he the one wear the helicopter  n  i have the terrible misfortune of have to view this bmovie in it entirety all i have to say be save your time and money this have get to be the bad bmovie of all time it shouldnt even be call a bmovie more like an fmovie because it fail in all aspect that make a good movie the story be not interesting at all all of the actor be paperthin and not at all believable it have bad direction and the action sequence be so fake it almost funny          almost the movie be just pack full of crappy oneliners that no respectable person could find amuse in the least little bit this movie be suppose to be gear towards men but all the woman in it be so utterly unattractive especially that old wrinkle thing that come in towards the end they try to appear sexy in those weird horrible costume and they fail miserably even some of the most ridiculous bmovies will still give you some laugh but this be just too painful to watch  n  what an absolutely stunning movie if you have hrs to kill watch it you wont regret it it too much fun rajnikanth carry the movie on his shoulder and although there isnt anything more other than him i still like it the music by a r rehman take time to grow on you but after you hear it a few time you really start like it  n  first of all let get a few thing straight here a i be an anime fan always have be a a matter of fact i use to watch speed racer all the time in preschool b i do like several bmovies because theyre hilarious c i like the godzilla movie a lot moving on when the movie first come on it seem like it go to be your usual bmovie down to the crappy fx but all a sudden boom the anime come on this be when the movie go wwwaaaaayyyyy downhill the animation be very bad cheap even bad than what i remember from speed racer for crissakes in fact it so cheap one of the few scene from the movie i vividly remember be when a bunch of kid run out of a school     it the same kid over over again the fx be terrible too the dinosaur look bad than godzilla in addition the transition to live action to animation be unorganized the dialogue voice especially the english dub that i view be horrid i be beg my dad to take the tape out of the dvd  vhs player the only thing that keep me survive be crack out joke comment like the robot joel mike on mstk you pick the season honestly this be the only way to barely enjoy this movie survive it at the same time heck im planning to show this to another fellow otaku pal of mine on halloween for a bmovie night because it stupid pretty painful to watch unintentionally hilarious at the same time im give this movie a an improvement from the i be originally go to give it accord to my grade scale mean pretty much both boring bad as fun a counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it then it will become as fun a counting to  n  this be the bad movie i saw at worldfest and it also receive the least amount of applause afterwards i can only think it be receive such recognition base on the amount of known actor in the film it great to see j beals but shes only in the movie for a few minute m parker be a much good actress than the part allow for the rest of the acting be hard to judge because the movie be so ridiculous and predictable the main character be totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch there be no real emotional depth to the story a movie revolve about an actor who cant get work doesnt feel very original to me nor do the development of the cop it feel like one of many straighttovideo movie i saw back in the s     and not even a good one in those standard  n  the karen carpenter story show a little more about singer karen carpenter complex life though it fail in give accurate fact and details cynthia gibb portrays karen be not a fine election she be a good actress but play a very naive and sort of dumb karen carpenter i think that the role need a strong character someone with a strong personality louise fletcher role a agnes carpenter be terrific she do a great job a karen mother it have great song which could have be include in a soundtrack album unfortunately they werent though this movie be on the top of the rating in usa and other several country  n  the cell be an exotic masterpiece a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer but also into one of a very talented director this be conclusive evidence of what can be achieve if human being unleash their uninhibited imagination this be boldness at work push aside thought to fall into formula and cliche and create something truly magnificent this be the best movie of the year to date ive read numerous complaint about this film anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast character and bad act to negatively criticize this film be to miss the point this movie may be a landmark a tradition where future movie will hopefully follow the cell have just open the door to another world of imagination so can we slam the door in it face and tell it and it director tarsem singh that we dont want any more personally i would more than welcome another movie by tarsem and would love to see someone try to challenge him weve all heard talk about go inside the mind of a serial killer and yes i do agree that the genre be a bit overwork the s be full of movie try to depict what make serial killer tick some of them work but most failed but the cell do not blaze down the same trail we be give a new twist we be physically transport into the mind and present with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studied i like how the movie do not bog u down with too much scientific jargon try to explain how jennifer lopez actually get to enter the ain of another instead she just lie down on a laboratory table and be wrap with what look like really long twizzlers and jaunt into another entity the cell want to let you see what it all about and not how it all about and i guess thats what some people dont like true i do like explanation with my movie but when a movie venture onto new ground you must let it do what it desire and simply take it in i notice how the film be very dark when it show reality maybe to contrast the ight visuals when inside the ain of another nonetheless the set design be simply astonish i wouldnt be surprise if this film take home a few oscar in cinematography best costume best director and the like if it be up to me itd at least get nominate for best picture ive notice that ive kind of be repeat myself not because there nothing else to say but because i cant stress enough how fantastic i think the cell be if you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it take over with wonder and an eyepopping feast then you be assure a good time i guess this film be just a little too much for some people write it off a weird or crazy i be very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind so it be right down my alley leave the theater i hear one audience member say whoever make that movie sure do a lot of good drug if so i want what he be smoke      out of  n  this film try to be too many thing all at once sting political satire hollywood blockbuster sappy romantic comedy family value promo     the list go on and on it fail miserably at all of them but there be enough interest to keep me from turn it off until the end although i appreciate the spirit behind war inc  it depress me to see such a clumsy effort especially when it will be take by it target to reflect the lack of the existence of a serious critique rather than simply the poor writing direction and production of this particular film there be a critique to be make about the corporatization of war but poke fun at it in this way diminish the true atrocity of what be happen reminds me a bit of three king which similarly trivialize a genuine cause for concern  n  this movie be so frustrating everything seem energetic and i be totally prepared to have a good time i at least thought id be able to stand it but i be wrong first the weird loop it be like watch americas funny home video the damn parent i hat them so much the stereotypical latino family i need to speak with the person responsible for this we need to have a talk that little girl who be always hang on someone i just hat her and have to mention it now the final scene transcends i must say it so gloriously bad and full of badness that it be a movie of it own what crappy dance horrible and beautiful at once  n  war movie be a hollywood genre that have be do and redo so many time that clich  d dialogue rehash plot and overthetop action sequence seem unavoidable for any conflict deal with largescale combat once in a while however a war movie come along that go against the grain and ings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen the civil warera cold mountain star jude law nicole kidman and ren  e zellweger be such a film then again call cold mountain a war movie be not entirely accurate true enough the film open with a quite literally quickanddirty battle sequence that put glory director edward zwick shame however cold mountain be not so much about the civil war itself a it be about the period and the people of the time the story center around disgruntled confederate soldier inman play by jude law who become disgust with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of cold mountain north carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he leave behind ada monroe play by nicole kidman at first glance this setup appear formulaic a the romantic interest back home give the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier tribulation on the battlefield indeed the early segment of the film be relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived cold mountain soon take a drastic turn though a the intrepid hero inman turn out to be a deserter incidentally save the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of want to root for the confederate and begin a long odyssey homeward meanwhile back at the farm ada culture way prove of little use in the field soon she be transform into something of a wilderbeast come to adas rescue be the course toughasnails ruby thewes play by ren  e zellweger who help ada put the farm back together and perhaps more importantly cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seem to have ought upon ada within these two setting a vivid compelling and at time very disturb portrait of the wartorn south unfolds the character with whom inman and ada interact be surprisingly complex enhance by wonderful performance of brendan gleeson a ruby deadbeat father ray winstone a an unrepentant southern lawman and natalie portman a a deeply troubled and isolated young mother all have be greatly affected and change by the war of northern aggression mostly for the bad the dark pervade antiwar message accent by an effective haunting score and chillingly beautiful shot of virginia and north carolina be communicate to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scene a by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war be fight though the weapon and tactic of war itself have change much in the past century it hellish effect on the land be timelessly relevant director anthony minghella manage to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film but the atmosphere be unfortunately denigrate by a rather tepid climax that do little justice to the wonderfully form character the love story between inman and ada be awkwardly tack onto the beginning and end of the film though the inherently distant abstract and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fit the dismal nature of the rest of the plot make no mistake cold mountain have neither the trait of a feelgood romance nor an inspiring war drama it be a unique vision of an era that be sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the life of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of it terrible repercussion altogether  n  taut and organically grip edward dmytryks crossfire be a distinctive suspense thriller an unlikely message movie use the look and device of the noir cycle bivouacked in washington dc a company of soldier cope with their restlessness by hang out in bar three of them end up at a stranger apartment where robert ryan drunk and belligerent beat their host sam levene to death because he happen to be jewish police detective robert young investigates with the help of robert mitchum who assign to ryans outfit suspicion fall on the second of the three george cooper who have vanish ryan slay the third buddy steve brodie to insure his silence before young close in abetted by a superior script by john paxton dmytryk draw precise performance from his three star bob ryan naturally do his prototypical angry white male and to the hilt while mitchum underplays with his characteristic alert nonchalance his role however be not central young may never have be good gloria grahame give her first fullyfledged rendition of the smartmouthed vulnerable tramp and a a sad sack who leech into her life paul kelly haunt u in a small peripheral role that he make memorable the politically engage dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumb to sermonize but it pretty much confine to young reminiscence of how his irish grandfather die at the hand of bigot a century earlier thus incidentally stretch chronology to the limit at least there no attempt to render an explanation however glib of why ryan hate jew and hillbilly and      curiously crossfire survives even the major change work upon it the novel it base on richard brook the brick foxhole dealt with a gaybashing murder but homosexuality in be still beyond the pale news of the holocaust have however begin to emerge from the ash of europe so hollywood felt embolden to register it protest against antisemitism the studio always quake at the prospect of offend any potential ticket buyer  but while the change from homophobia to antisemitism work in general the specific dont fit so smoothly the victim chat up a lonesome drunk young soldier then invite him back home look odd even though or especially since there a girlfriend in tow it raise the question whether this scenario be retain inadvertently or leave in a a discreet tipoff to the original engine generate ryans murderous rage  n  ardh satya be one of the fine film ever make in indian cinema direct by the great director govind nihalani this one be the most successful hard hit parallel cinema which also turn out to be a commercial success even today ardh satya be an inspiration for all lead director of india the film tell the reallife scenario of mumbai police of the s  unlike any police of other city in india mumbai police encompass a different system altogether govind nihalani create a very practical outlay with real life approach of mumbai police environment amongst various police officer colleague the film describe the story of anand velankar a young hotblooded cop come from a poor family his father be a harsh police constable anand himself suffers from his father ideology incidence of his father atrocity on his mother anands approach towards immediate action against crime be an inert craving for his own job satisfaction the film be here revolve in a plot wherein anands constant effort against crime be trample by his seniors this lead to frustration a he can not achieve the desired jobsatisfaction result from the frustration his anger be express in excessive violence in the remand room bar also turn him to an alcoholic the spirit within him be still alive a he constantly fight the system he be aware of the system of the metro where the police politician be a inertly associate by far end his compromise towards unethical practice be negative finally he get suspended the direction be a master piece thoroughly hard core one of the best memorable scene be when anand eaks in the underworld gangster rama shettys house to arrest him follow by short conversation which be fantastic at many scene the film have hairraising moments the practical approach of script be a major punch alcoholism corruption political influence courage deception all be integral part of mumbai police even today those aspect be deal illiantly finally the film belongs to the one man show om puri portray anand velankar traverse through all his emotion absolutely illiantly  n  my first exposure to the templarios not a good one i be excite to find this title among the offering from anchor bay video which have ought u other cult classic such a spider baby the print quality be excellent but this alone cant hide the fact that the film be deadly dull theres a thrill opening sequence in which the villager exact a terrible revenge on the templar set the whole thing in motion but everything else in the movie be slow ponderous ultimately unfulfilling add insult to injury the movie be dub not subtitle a promise on the video jacket  n  one of the most significant quote from the entire film be pronounce halfway through by the protagonist the mafia middleman titta di girolamo a physically nondescript middleaged man originally from salerno in southern italy when be introduce to him at the start of the film he be live a nonlife in an elegant but sterile hotel in the italianspeaking canton of switzerland for the last ten year conduct a business we be only gradually introduce to while this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene take place employee of the the swiss bank who normally count di girolamos cash tell him that dollar be miss from his usual suitcase full of tightly stack banknote at the news he quietly but icily threaten his coax bank manager of want to close down his account meanwhile he tell u the spectator that when you bluff you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of be catch out or appear ridiculous he say you cant bluff for a while and then halfway through tell the truth have eventually do this bluffed only halfway through and tell the truth and have accept the consequence of life and ultimately love be exactly the reason behind the beginning of titta di girolamos trouble this initially unsympathetic character a scowl taciturn curt man on the verge of a man who wont even reply in kind to chambermaid and waitress who say hello and goodbye becomes at one point someone the spectator care deeply about at one point in his nonlife titta decide to feel concern about appear ridiculous the first half of the film may be describe a slow by some it do indeed reveal di girolamos day and night in that hotel at an oddly disjoined deliberate pace reveal seemingly mundane and irrelevant detail however scene that may have seem unnecessary reveal just how essential they be a this masterfully construct and innovative film unfolds before your eye the existence of titta di girolamo the man with no imagination identity or life the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least think you would be also convey with elegantly edit sequence and very interesting use of music one theme by the scottish band board of canada especially stand out never be the contrast between the way hollywood and italy treat mobster more at odds than since the release of film such a le conseguenze dellamore or limbalsamatore another interesting element be the way in which the film make use of the protagonist insomnia not unlike the machinist and in a far more explicit way the al pacino film insomnia le conseguenze dellamore use this condition to symbolise a deep emotional malaise thats be ram so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious it almost impossible to pinpoint it cause if indeed there be one the young and sympathetic hotel waitress sofia play by olivia magnani granddaughter of the legendary anna and the memory of tittas best friend a man whom he hasnt see in year unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that titta eventually though tentatively at first accepts to look through again though it never explicitly spell out the spectator know that to a man like titta accept the consequence of love will have unimaginable consequence a film without a single scene of sex or violence a film that unfold in it own time and concedes nothing to the spectator expectation le conseguenze dellamore be a fine representative of that small quiet discreet renaissance that have be take place in italian cinema since the decline of cinecitt  during the second half of the s  the world be wait for italy to produce more il postinolike fare more la vita    bellastyle film     neglect to explore fine creation like le conseguenze dellamore limbalsamatore and others your loss world  n  i watch this film not really expect much i get it in a pack of film all of which be pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could i expect and you know what i be right they be all terrible this movie have a few and a few be stretch it interesting point the occasional camcorder view be a nice touch the drummer be very like a drummer i e damn annoying and well thats about it actually the problem be that it just so boring in what i can only assume be an attempt to build tension a whole lot of nothing happens and when it do it utterly tedious i have my thumb on the fast forward button ready to press for most of the movie but give it a go and seriously be the lead singer of the band that great look coz they dont half mention how beautiful he be a hell of a lot i think he look a bit like a meercat all this and i havent even mention the killer im not even gon na go into it it just not worth explain anyway as far a im concern star and london be just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of london who be actually quite funny it wasnt because of their acting talent ive certainly see a lot bad but ive also see a lot well best avoid unless your bored of watch paint dry  n  i buy this film at blockbuster for because it sound interest a bit ranmaesque with the idea of someone drag around a skeleton because there be a cute girl in a miniskirt on the back and because there be a restricted viewing sticker on it i think it be go to be a sweet or at least sincere come of age story with a weird indie edge i be wrong having watch it i have to wonder how it get the restrict sticker since there be hardly any foul language little violence and the close thing to nudity honestly i dont usually go around hop for it be when the girl be in her nightgown and you see her panty you see her panty a lot in this movie because no matter what shes wear a miniskirt of some sort even the antireligious humor be tame and lame caricature insincere derivative unoriginal and bad of all not funny in the slightestit would be well just to listen to ray stevens would jesus wear a rolex on his television show this would barely qualify a pg it be not rat but blockbuster refuse to let anyone under the age of rent thisas if it be pornographic any little kid could go in there and rent the edited version of requiem for a dream but they insist that zack and reba be worse it be but not in that way in a way this worry methe only thing leave that could offend people be the idea of the suicide at the beginning if anybody need to see movie with honestly portray suicides not this one but good one like the virgin suicides it teenager if both of those movie be rat r purely because of the suicide aspect then i have little chance of turn a story ive be write into a pg movie the main character be eleven and a half and twelve suicide be one of the top three lead cause of death in teenager i think it number so chance be that most teen have be or will be affect by it just say no to this movie though  n  the plot be about the death of little child hopper be the one who have to investigate the killing during the movie it appear that he have some trouble with his daughter in the end the serial killer get catch thats it but before you find out who dunnit you have to see some terrible acting by all of the actor it be unbelievable how bad these actor be include hopper i could go on like this but that to much of a waste of my time just dont watch the movie ive warn you  n  ever watch a movie that lose the plot well this didnt even really have one to begin with where to begin the achingly tedious scene of our heroine sit around the house with actually no sense of menace or even forebode create even during the apparently constant thunderstorm that be strangely never actually hear in the housegreat double glaze the house that be apparently only a few mile from a town yet be several hour walk away or the third girl who serve no purpose to the plot except to provide a surprisingly quick gory murder just a the tedium become unbearable or even the beginning which suggest a spate of killing throughout the area even though it be apparent the killer never venture far from the house or the bizarre ritual with the salt pepper that pretty much sum up most of the film inherent lack of direction add a lead actress who cant act but at least be willing to do some completely irrelevant nude shower scene and this video be truly nasty but not in the way you hope given a following simply for be ban in the uk in the s mostly because of a final surprisingly over extended murder it offer nothing but curiosity value and one classic daft murder dont worryits telegraph at least ten minute before  after a walk in the wood our victim come to a rather steep upward slope which they obviously struggle up halfway through they see a figure at the top dress in black and andishing a large scythe what do they do slide down and run like the rest of u no of course not they struggle to the top and stand conveniently nice and upright in front of the murder weapon it really be only a movie a they say    n  okay so this series kind of take the route of here we go again week in week out david mors character help out his ride who be in a bit of a pickle but whats wrong with that david morse be one of the great character actor out there and certainly the coolest and to have him in a series create by david koepp a great writer be heaven due to the lack of love for this show by many i cant see it go to a season series but you never know the amount of rubbish that have make it beyond that baffle me let hope something good can make it past a first series  n  after sit through this pile of dung my husband and i wonder whether it be actually the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie it be that listless and formulaic but the u s  propaganda throw in your face throughout the film provesdisappointinglythat it the work of human call me a conspiracy theorist but quote like we have to steal the declaration of independence to protect it seem like way to justify action like the invasion of iraq etc the fact that nicholas cage spews line like i would never use the declaration of independence a a bargaining chip with a straight face make me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast take valium before shoot each scene the reasoning behind each plot turn and new clue be truly ridiculous and impossible to follow and there also a bonus side plot of misogyny with dr  whateverhernamewas be chide by all involve for never shut up shes clearly in the movie only for look but they felt the need to slap a dr  title on her character to give her some gravity at one point cage character say dont you ever shut up and the camera pan to her look poutily down at her hand like shes a child truly grotesque the only benefit to this movie be that it so astonishingly bad you do get a few laugh out of it the really scary thing be that a majority of the people watch the movie with u seem to enjoy it creepy      n  it have all the clich  s of movie of this type and no substance the plot go nowhere and at the end of the movie i felt like a sucker for watch it the production be good however the script and act be bmovie quality the casting be poor because there be good actor mix in with crumby actor the good actor didnt hold their own nor do they lift up the others this movie be not worthy of more word but i will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten line james wood and cuba gooding jr  play caricature of themselves in other movie if you be look for mindless entertainment i still wouldnt recommend this movie  n  this movie be base on the book a many splendored thing by han suyin and tackle issue of race relation between asian and white a topic that come from han personal experience a an eurasian grow up in china that background and the beautiful hong kong setting give this love story a unique and rather dare atmosphere for it time other than that the story be a stereotypical romance with a memorable song that be perhaps more remembered than the movie itself the beautiful jennifer jones look the part and give a wonderful oscar nominated performance a a doctor of mixed eed during the advent of communism in mainland china william holden never look well play a romantic lead a a journalist cover war torn region in the world the acting be top notch and the chemistry between the two lover provide for some genuine moment of silver screen affection sure to melt the heart of those who be romantically inclined the cinematography really ings out fiftys hong kong especially the hilltop overlook the harbor where the two lover spend their most intimate moment the end be a real tearjerker some may consider sentimental romance pass   but for those who enjoy classic hollywood love story this be a shining example  n  of all the film i have see this one the rage have get to be one of the bad yet the direction logic continuity change in plotscript and dialog make me cry out in pain how could anyone come up with something so crappy gary busey be know for his b movie but this be a sure w movie w waste  take for example about two dozen fbi local law officer surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer inside the jeep be ma and be confuse a to why all the cop be about within second a huge gun battle ensue ma be kill straight off the cop blast away at the jeep with gary and company blast away at them the cop fall like domino and the jeep with gary drive around in circle and be not hit by one single bullet pellet ma be kill and gary seem to not to have noticeddamn that guy be tough truly a miracle not since the sixshooter hold bullet have there be such a miracle  n  i have hear good thing about state of grace and come in with an open mind i think that god army be okay and i think that maybe dutcher have improve and mature a a filmmaker the film begin with some shaky acting and i think well maybe it will get well unfortunately it never do the picture start out by introduce two elder mormon missionary and it seem that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them instead the story degenerate into a highly improbable series of unfortunate event highlight blatant disobedience by the missionary something that undeniably exists but rarely on the level that dutcher portrays and it become almost laughable dutchers only success in this movie be his successful alienation of his target audience by unrealistically and inaccurately portray the life of mormon missionary dutcher accomplishes nothing more than anger his predominantly mormon audience the film in no way reflect reality mission be nothing like what dutcher show have serve a mormon mission myself i can attest to this fact and gang life in california certainly contain much more explicit language than the occasional mild vulgarity the conclusion which im assume be suppose to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness be available to all be both unbelievable cmon the entire mission gather to see this elder send home and the mom and the girl be stand right next to each other and cheesy next time dutch try make a movie that someone can identify with  n  this movie strike home for me be i remember the s and my father work in a factory i figure if i work hard too if i have pride and never give up i too could have the american dream the house a few kid a car all to call my own ive note however without a degree in something unlike my father that quit at ninth grade and a keen sense of greed and laziness you cant get anywhere i would like to know if anyone have this movie on dvd or vhs it make for tv and i just saw it an hour ago ic ant find it anywhere id love to show this to my friend my pseudo friend family and other relative see what they think and remind them that once upon a time american would work for the sake of feel honor and that we have pride in what we accomplish i think the feeling be still there but in a heavy downward spiral with so many thing be make overseas      n  a a disclaimer ive see the movie time in the last year and i only just saw the musical this week this allow me to judge the movie without be taint by what be or wasnt in the musical however it taint me when i watch the musical i actually believe michael douglas work quite well in that role along with kasey i think her let me dance for you scene be one of the best part of the movie a worthwhile addition compare to the musical the dancer and sing in the movie be much superior to the musical as well a the cast which be at least time big easy to do in the movie of course the decor light dancing and singing be also much superior in the movie which should be expect and be indeed deliver the song that be in common with the musical be well do in the movie the new one be quite good one and the whole movie just deliver more than the musical in my opinion especially compare to a musical which have few decor the one bad point on the movie be the obvious cut between the actor talk and dubbed singer during the singing portion for some of the character but their dancing be impeccable and the end product be more enjoyable than the musical  n  protocol be an implausible movie whose only save grace be that it star goldie hawn along with a good cast of support actor the story revolve around a ditzy cocktail waitress who become famous after inadvertently save the life of an arab dignitary the story go downhill halfway through the movie and goldies charm just doesnt save this movie unless you be a goldie hawn fan dont go out of your way to see this film  n  how this film could be classify a drama i have no idea if i be john voight and mary steenburgen i would be try to erase this from my cv it be a historically accurate a xena and hercules aaham and moses get meld into noah lot aahams nephew lot turn up thousand of year before he would have be bear canaanite wander the earth     really what be the scriptwriter thinking be it just ignorance i remember something about noah and animal and lot and canaanite and all that stuff from sunday school or be they try to offend the maximum number of people on the planet a possible from christian jew and muslim to historian archaeologist geologist psychologist linguist     a a matter of fact do anyone not get offend anyone who have even a modicum of taste would have wince at this one  n  preston sturgis the power and the glory be unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty year until the late s when it resurface and even show up on television in the meantime it have gain in notoriety because pauline kaels the citizen kane book have suggest that the herman mankiewicz orson welles screenplay for kane be base on sturgis screenplay here as be mention in the beginning of this thread for the film on the imdb web site kael overstate her case there be about six narrator who take turn deal with the life of charles foster kane the newsreel represent ralston the henry luce clone thatcher memoirs bernstein jed leland susan alexander kane and raymond the butler each have his or her different slant on kane reflect their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man and of course each also reveal his or her own failing when they be tell their version of kanes story this method also lead to frequent overlap retellings of the same incident this be not the situation in the power and the glory yes like kane it be about a legendary business leader here it be tom garner spencer tracy a man who rise from the bottom to be head of the most successful railroad system in the country but there be only two narrator they be garner right hand man henry ralph morgan and his wife sarah padden this restrict the nearly three dimensional view we get at time of kane in garner henry when he narrate be talk about his bos and friend whom he respect and love his wife be like the voice of the skeptical public she see only the flaw in henry typical example although he work his way up tom become more and more antilabor in his late year union be troublemaker and he do not care to be slow down by their shenanigan henry describes tom confrontation with the union in a major walkout and how it preoccupy him to the detriment of his home life but henrys wife remind him how tom use scab and violence to end the strike apparently blow up the union headquarters kill many people so we have two view of the man but one be pure white and one be pure black im not really knock the power and the glory for not duplicate kanes success few film do include all of orson welles other film but i be aware that the story be present well enough to hold one interest to the end and thanks to the performance of tracy and colleen moore a his wife sally the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair be fully ought home when they marry tom want to do well in part to give his wife and their family the benefit he never have but in america great business success come at a cost tom get deeply involved with run the railroad empire he expand it and improve it constantly but it take him away from home too much and he lose touch with sally and he also notice eve helen vinson the young woman who become his mistress when sally learn of his unfaithful behavior it destroy her similarly tom too get a full shock which make him a martyr in the eye of henry eve marries tom and present him with a son but it turn out to be eve son by tom son tom jr  philip trent the discovery of this incestuous cuckolding cause tom to shoot himself the film be not a total success the action jump at time unconvincingly yet it do make the business seem real note the scene when tom tell his board of director about his plan to purchase a small rival train line and he discuss the use of debenture for finance the plan sturgis come from a wealthy background so he could ing in this type of detail so on the whole it be a first rate film no citizen kane perhaps but of interest to movie lover a an attempt at business realism with social commentary in depression america  n  average and surprisingly tame fulci giallo which mean it still quite bad by normal standard but redeem by it solid buildup and some nice touch such a a neat time twist on the issue of vision and clairvoyance the genre wellknown weakness be in full gear banal dialogue wooden act illogical plot point and the finale go on much too long while the denouement prove to be a rather lame or shall i say limp affair fulcis ironic handling of giallo norm be amuse though yellow clue wherever you look out of limp killer  n  return to the th chamber be one of those classic kungfu movie which shaw produce back in the s and s whose genre be equivalent to the spaghetti western of hollywood and the protagonist gordon liu the counterpart to the western clint eastwood digitally remastered and a new print make for the fantastic film fest this be present in shaw scope just like the good old days this film be a simple story of good versus evil tell in act which more or less sum up the narrative of martial art film in that era act one set up the premise worker in a dyemill of a small village be unhappy with their lot have their wage cut by by incoming manchu gangster they cant do much about their exploitation because none of them be martial art skilled to take on the gangster and their bos at first they have a minor success in get liu to impersonate a highly skilled shaolin monk one of the best comedy sequence but their rouse get expose when they push the limit of credibility by impersonate one too many times act two show the protagonist want to get back at the mob however without real martial art he embark on a journey to shaolin temple to try and infiltrate and learn martial art on the sly after some slapstick moment he finally get accept by the abbot whom he impersonate but be disappoint at the teach method kinda like mr miyagis style in karate kid but instead of paint fence he get to erect scaffolding all around the temple nothing can keep a good man down and he unwittingly build strength endurance and learn kungfu the unorthodox way act three be where the fight fest begin with cheesy sound effect each obvious noncontact on film be give the maximum impact treatment but it be rather refresh watch the fight scene here with it wide angled shot to highlight clarity and detail between the spar partner and the use of slowmotion only to showcase stunt in different angle you may find the speed of fight a tad too slow with some pause in between move but with yuen wo ping and his style be use adnausem in hollywood flick they sure dont make fight scene like they use to return to the th chamber get a repeat screen on monday so if youre game for a nostalgic trip down memory lane what be you wait for  n     spoilers    all too in real life as well a in the movie familiar story

the aftermath of the french revolution and the terror of a strikingly similar to the post sociopolitical landscape maybe then they could stop worry about save face and take the a  whupping they deserve it really a shame that when a politician ruin the country those who vote for him cant be deny the right to ever vote again theyve clearly show they have no sense of character what really stand out in this movie be the ambiguity of a character a hopelessly doctrinaire a robespierre a haunt empty man who simplistic reductive ideology cant help him elucidate the boundary between safety and totalitarianism execution and murder selfdefense and patriotism his legalistic litmus test aggravate the hopeless situation he help create sound like any belligerent overprivileged retarded yale cheerleader you know of wojciech pszoniak blow the slovenly deparidieu off the screen as sympathetic a robespierre plight be it comfort to know that shortly after the film end hell have his jaw shoot off and be send to the guillotine  n  a someone have already mention on this board it very difficult to make a fake documentary it require tremendous skill pace patience directorial distance a plausible premise a narrative flow and really believable act aka great act such be not the case with love machine it start to show it faux hand about the minute mark with minute leave to watch and the viewer start to realize that he or she be be take in it downhill from there director gordon eriksen simply peak too soon but to be fair to eriksen his problem start early a he explain in the extra he begin want to do a real doc couldnt get funding and settle for a cheap way of make his film the premise people who have secret life by post themselves on a porn website be perhaps more interesting in when the film be make eriksen do a lot of tricky stuff a pushy host handheld camera zoom grainy black and white all i guess to elicit a sense of authenticity but it just doesnt work the film be confuse and force but what ultimately ings it down be the believability of the actor and the pretty awful dialogue  n  the hill have eye ii be what you would expect it to be and nothing more of course it not go to be an oscar nominate film it just pure entertainment which you can just lose yourself in for minutes the plot be basically about a group of national guard trainee who find themselves battle against the notorious mutated hillbilly on their last day of training in the desert it just them fight back throughout the whole film which include a lot of violence which be basically the whole film a blood and gut be constantly fly around throughout the whole thing and also yet another graphic rape scene which be pointlessly throw in to shock the audience id give the hill have eye ii out of for pure entertainment and that only although even then i find myself look at my watch more and more a the film go on a it begin to drag due to the fact it continue to try and shock the audience with graphic gore and the occasional jump scene just to make sure the audience stay awake the hill have eye ii be just decent entertainment something to pass time if youre bore and nothing else    n  i laugh all the way through this rotten movie it so unbelievable a woman leave her husband after many year of marriage have a eakdown in front of a real estate office what happen the office manager come outside and offer her a job hilarious next thing you know the two woman be go at it yep theyre lesbian nothing ring true in this lifetime for woman with nothing better to do movie clunky dialogue like i dont want to spend the rest of my life feel like i have a chance to be happy and didnt take it doesnt help theres a wealthy distant mother who disapprove of her daughter new relationship a sassy black maid unbelievable that in the year a film get make in which theres a sassy black maid hattie mcdaniel must be turn in her grave the woman have a husband who freak out and want custody of the snotty teenage kid sheesh no cliche be leave unturned  n  no spoiler after hitchcock successful first american film rebecca base upon daphne dumariers lush novel of gothic romance and intrigue he return to some of the more familiar theme of his early british period mistake identity and espionage a the u s  settle into world war ii and the large scale war effort of civilian build plane weaponry and other necessary militia the booming film entertainment business begin turn out paranoid and often jingoistic thriller with war time theme these thriller often involved network of deceptive and skilled operator at work in the shadow among the good law abide citizen know the director be at home in this espionage genre producer jack skirball approach hitchcock about direct a property he own that dealt with corruption wartime sabotage and a helpless hero thrust into a vortex of coincidence and mistaken identity the darker element of the narrative and the sharp wit of literary maven dorothy parker during her ief stint in hollywood before return to her bohemian root in nyc who coauthored the script be a perfect match for hitchcock sensibilities this often neglect film tell the story of the unfortunate year old barry kane robert cummings who while at work at a los angeles airplane factory meet new employee frank frye norman lloydd and moment later be frame for commit sabotage flee the authority who dont believe his farfetched story he meet several character on his way to soda city utah and finally new york city these memorable character include a circus

move forward and once ignited culminates in one of hitchcock more memorable finale look for incredibly life like nyc tourist attraction all of which be recreate by art director in hollywood due to the wartime shoot ban on public attraction while saboteur may not be one of hitchcock most well know film it a popular bmovie that be certainly solid and engage with plenty of clever plot twist and a usual terrific hitchcock villain remember to look for hitchcock cameo appearance outside a drug store in the second half of the film hitchcocks original cameo idea that be shoot him fight in sign language with his deaf wife be ax by the bureau of standard and practice who be afraid of offend the deaf  n  i just watch the dresser this evening have only see it once before about a dozen year ago its not a big movie and doesnt try to make a big splash but my god the illiance of the two lead leaf me just about speechless albert finney and tom courtenay be nothing less than amaze in this movie the dresser be the story of sir an age shakespearean actor finney and his dresser norman courtenay sort of a valet put on a production of king lear during the blitz of london in world war ii these be two men each dependent upon the other sir be almost helpless without the aid of norman to cajole wheedle and bully him into get onstage for his th performance of lear and norman live his life vicariously through sir without sir to need him he be nothing or think he be anyway this be a characterdriven film the plot be secondary to the interaction of the character and a such it require actor of the high caliber to ing it to life finney only year old be completely believable a a very old very sick petulant bullying but illiant stage actor he hiss and fume at his fellow actor even when theyre take their bow and courtenay be no less convincing a the mince dresser who must sometimes act more a a mother than a a valet to his elderly employer employer be really the wrong term to use though for although technically their relationship be that of employer and employee most of the time sir and norman act like nothing so much a an old married couple yes there be others in the cast of this movie but there be no question that the true star be finney courtenay and the marvelous script by ronald harwood that be not to say that there arent other fine performance most notably eileen atkins a the longsuffering stage manager madge there be a wonderful scene where sir and madge talk about old desire old regret and what might have been although it doesnt get talk about these day it be worth remember that the dresser be nominate for five academy award best actor nomination for both finney and courtenay best picture best director peter yates and best adapt screenplay i have remember this a be a good movie but i wasnt prepare to be a completely mesmerize a i be from begin to end if you want to see an example of what great acting be all about and be hugely entertain all the while then i encourage you to see the dresser  n  what happen what we have here be basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast but somewhere the movie lose it actually it never really get go there be a little excitement when we find out that angie be not really pregnant then find out that she be after all but that be it steve martin who be a very talented person and usually ings a lot to a movie be dreadful and his entire character be not even close to be important to this movie other than to make it long i really would have like to see more interaction between the main character kate and angie and maybe try not for a pure comedy which unfortunately it be not but maybe a drama with comedic element i think if the movie do this it could have be very funny since both actress be quite funny in their own way and sit here i can think of numerous scenario that would have be a riot  n  ive just watch fingersmith and im stun to see the average rating for the show not only be the plot be difficult to follow but it seem character development be randomly applied the actor be adequate but in the process of attempt to create twist and turn their character be render entirely one dimensional once this happen the story really fall flat and become tedious and just in case anyone didnt see the predictable lesbian undertone from mile way this be hammer home in the most banal term at the end of the film the end scene be disappointing and phone in and anyone who sit back and go ohhh so they be carpet muncher all along must have be out for the evening two star for the tonsil hockey in the early scene which be at least a bit raunchy none for the rest of it      n  so let begin the movie itself be as original a cronenbergs movie would usually appear     my intention to see it be certainly jjl be one of my favourite actress she be as lovely a usual this cutie i would not say it be my favourite movie of hers still it quite interesting and entertain to follow the rest of the cast be not extremely impressive but it be not some kind of a miscast star array recommend with confidence  n  besides be bore the scene be oppressive and dark the movie try to portray some kind of moral but fell flat with it message what be the redeem quality on top of that i dont think it could make liarians look any more unglamorous than it do  n  an unmarried woman name stella bette midler get pregnant by a wealthy man stephen collins he offer to marry her out of a sense of obligation but she turn him down flat and decides to raise the kid on her own thing go ok until the child name jenny trini alvarado become a teenager and thing gradually and predictably become worse ive see both the silent version and sound version of stella dallas neither one affect me much and i cry easily but they be wellmade if date try to remake this in be just a stupid idea i guess midler have enough power after the incomprehensible success of beach to get this make this predictably bomb the story be laughable and date by today standard even though midler and alvarado give good performance this film really drags and i be bore silly by the end stephen collins and marsha mason both good actor dont help in support role flimsy and dull reallywho think this would work see the stanwyck version instead i give this a  n  dont torture a duckling be one of fulcis earlier and honestly in term of storyline better     film and although not the typical bloodbath that fulci be know for this be still a very unique and enjoyable film the story surround a small town where a series of child murder be occur some of the colorful character involve in the investigation either a suspect or those help the investigation or in some case both include the towns police force a smalltime reporter a beautiful and rich exdrug addict a young priest and his mother an old man who practice witchcraft and his female prot  g   a mentally handicapped townsman and a deaf mute little girl all of these people be interweave into the plot to create several twist and turn until the actual killer be reveal     dont torture a duckling be neither a classical giallo or a typical fulci gore film although it do contain element of both it be more of an oldfashioned murder mystery with darker subject matter and a few scene of graphic violence although nothing nearly as strong a some of fulcis later work this be a well write film with lot of twist that keep me guess up until the end recommend for giallo murdermystery fan or anyone look to check out some of fulcis nonsplatter film but dont despair dont torture still have more than it fair share of violence and sleaze some may be put off by the subject of the child killing and one main female character have a strange habit of hit on very young boy which be also kind of disconcert but if that type of material doesnt bother you then definitely give this one a look  n  busty beauty stacie randall play pvc clad badass bitch alexandra the faithful acolyte of faust an evil entity trap in hell determine to free her master the malevolent minx eaks into a warehouse to steal a magical gem vital to her success but whilst conduct a satanic ritual to summon faust the silly mare accidentally enter the pentagram she have draw on the floor which result in the loss of the gem and the release of two diminutive trolllike creature call lite and dark now alexandra must find a replacement gem which isnt go to be easy the only other stone that will do the trick be wear around the neck of her exlover police detective jonathan graf peter liapis who be investigate the warehouse robbery and who know only too well what evil alexandra be capable of meanwhile wisecrack interdimensional halfpints lite and dark get into all sort of zany trouble a they try to find a way back home in the warped movie world of jim wynorski all female be bigeasted babe with the fashion sense of a cheap hooker ghoulies iv be no exception every woman in this film  whether she be a police captain a curator of antiquity or a mental patient in an asylum  is hot hot hot and wear not a lot and it this fact that make this otherwise totally unwatchable piece of stv crap just about bearable but be warn even though the presence of seminaked quality crumpet make the go slightly easy there be still plenty about this film to warrant it be label a an ordeal the acting be wooden and the dialogue be painful the black humour a the dvd blurb describe it be about as funny a a knee to the knacker with the comedic banter of lite and dark be particularly cringeworthy and the special effect be bargain basement consisting of rubbery creature and visual effect that would have look date ten year earlier   solely for the high bimbo quotient  n  i really like salman kahn so i be really disappointed when i see this movie it didnt have much of a plot and what they do have be not that appeal salman however do look good in the movie look young and refresh but be worth the price of this dvd the music be not bad it be quite nice usually indian movie be at least two to three hour long but this be a very short movie for an indian film the american actress that play in the movie be from the television hit series hero ali larter her acting have a lot to be desire however she do look good in the indian dress that she wear all the movie have not a lot to be desire and i hope salman do a lot well on his next movie thank you  n  im not sure why the producer need to trade on the name of a somewhat successful movie franchise because the title suggest that it be a sequel to the first three movies  which it be not even though marque houston do appear in hp he play a totally different character he be eight year old in this film okay     so reid and martin werent the most talented and couldnt carry a film all by themselves  but to trade on the hp franchise seem to me that there could have make some sort of reference albeit minor to the early movie im sure everyone who want to see it be hoodwinkedinto thinking that they be see a sequelnot a totally different film with a familiar name and im sorry     kym whitley be not funny and could not hold a candle to the late robin harris ketty lester or dc curry in the early film although meagen good and mari morrow be a substantial visual diversion     i have to give this a thumbs down just name the film down to the last minute would have be ok  furthermore the hudlin others who produce the first three movie be not involve in the making of this film  n  this film labour along with some of the most predictable story line and shallow character ever see the writer obviously buy the playbook how to write a space disaster movie and follow it play by play in particular the stereotypical use of astronaut talk to their love one from out space put on a ave show in the face of disaster have be do time and time again max q appear to have be write in the hope that the producer would throw million at the project but judging by the latter half of the film which contain numerous lame attempt at special effect the producer could only muster thousand to learn that the film be nominate for a special visual effect emmy have me absolutely gobsmacked i think a handful of high school student with a pas in medium study could have create more believable effect and the plot hole be too numerous to mention but i will pick one out a an example now im no nasa expert but surely it highly implausible that a worker attach to the shuttle simulator would suddenly hold a position of power in the control room when thing start to go pearshaped with the program surely there be someone more experienced at mission control who the program director would call on rather than a twentynine year old who have not be in the control room before the only save grace for this film be the work of bill campbell he manage to make a good attempt at salvage something out of the train wreck that be this script i give this film out of with the aboveaverage work of bill campbell in the lead role save it from a low mark  n  caddyshack two be a good movie by itself but compare to the original it cant stack up robert stack be a horrible replacement for ted knight and jackie mason while funny just cant compete with rodney dangerfield ty webb be funny be the only character from the original most of the other character in the movie lack the punch of the original henry wilcoxon for example except for the hystericly funny lawyer peter blunt be play by randy quaid every line he say remind me of the original humor especially the scene at his office i dont go in for law suit or motion i find out where you live and come to your house and beat down your door with a f   ing baseball bat make a bonfire with the chippindalemaybe roast that golden retriever arff arff arff then eat it and then im comin upstairs junior and im grab you by your ooks others pjs and cram your and new bmw up your tight a   do we have an understanding offset his small role however be dan acroyd who be obviously no replacement for bill murray his voice be beyond irritate and everything he do isnt even funny it just stupid overall caddyshack ii be a good movie but in comparison to the awesome original it just cant cut it  n  honestly this short film suck the dummy use in the necro scene be pretty well make but still phony enough look to ruin the viewing experience the unearthed dvd be crisp and clear and i havent make up my mind if this help or hinders it if the film be a little grainy it might have add some creepiness factor to what be go on i have no idea why this film have so much hype surround it other than the subject matter but to be honest the necrophilia scene in film like nekromantik and visitor q among others be more shocking than in aftermath all this talk about the film be about loneliness and all other manner of deep philosophy be bull     this be an expensive beautifully film turd it not that shock it not that disgust if you insist on view it rent it i give it a for the fact that not many people make explicit movie about necrophilia there should definitely be a big selection for u sickos the filming be good and it do have some gore if watch a rubbery look doll get cut open be consider gore     but other than that absolutely nothing go for this overhyped mess on the other hand genesis cerdas sequel to aftermath now available a a double feature release by unearthed film be an absolute masterpiece of a short film really show what a good director cerda really be when give the right material although i dont care for aftermath at all genesis be so well make that i will forgive cerda and definitely keep an eye out for him in the future      n  i think that mukhsin have be wonderfully write it not just about entertainment there tonne of subtle message that i think yasmin be try to ing across and yes it might be confuse to some of you especially if you didnt watch sepet and or gua for time  i bet u notice how they use character from the two movie before right it really ironic how the character relate like the bossy neighbour be that prostitute from gua and the chick at the snooker pad turn out to be the religious and wife of the pious man in the future and i absolutely love the voiceovers it crude yet awakeningly fresh like when they take a shot of the rumah tumpangan gamin signboard then there be suddenly mukhsins voice say bismillahhirrahmannirrahim   the scene when he climb the tree  it capture malaysian attitude and in some mild way snigger at how pathetic it be portray in the character for example even the kid can be really sharp tongue complete with the shrill annoy voice and simply bad mouth ppl all movie long and how you can be such a busybody and talk about ppl when ur own life isnt sort out all i can say be this movie totally reach my expectation if not exceed it it keep me glue to the screen i couldnt even take my eye off it not even to make out in the cinema ha ha  n  i be not a golf fan by any mean on may about pm the movie start with a scene in the late s  old movie i like but not golf however within the first scene a young boy harry vardon be awaken by the voice of men he go outside to inquire what they be do and be tell they be go to build a golf something     so then i turn the television off but something stir me and it be back on the movie be excellent we then see this young boy now a man professional golf player who be haunt with vision from his childhood then we meet the true focus of the movie francis and the decision he make for golf you meet his mother and father who want to protect him from the class thing that be so obvious during the period then there be little eddie lowery his caddy with encouraging word and little push that be instrumental in francis win dont want to give away too much i be up until a m  this be super please see the movie  n  upon view tobe hoopers gem crocodile in i develop a great interest in the college crocodile niche of the exploitation monster genre i look forward to a wayward producer to follow up with several sequel to these delightful bonbon of camp goodness if only ed wood could ing his subtle sense of flair and dignity to these remarkable script with ed write the script and a room full of monkees create crocodile special effect on a computer all wed need would be a cast of crocky fodder with russ meyer east and ren hoek pectoral implants while tobe hoopers crocky opus reference his own movie blood surf chose to dish out a bunch of age theme from the chum bucket of other movie see if you can look past the revenge of the nerd sequel set to find the allusions homages  ripoffs to jaw temple of doom indiana jones last crusade the convent godzilla and any james bond movie also try to find the readyfortv fade where the editor give up on make sense of the stock i be disappoint the crock didnt get to try out it sotto voce tenor with a soliloquy on environmentalism     or crocky appreciation but the quasicaptain ahab of the story do get his tour de force speach perhaps in the come year well see a crock gallop off after a shootout into a golden sunset or hopefully a monkey will flush a crocky down the toilet of an international space station for midget and enjoy the exploitative waltz of zerog monkey midget crocodile bloodshed allinall the lack of a whammy bar in the surf music irk me  n  it try to be the epic adventure of the century and with a cast like sh   kasugi christopher lee and johnrhys davy it really be the perfect badventure of all time it actually be a pretty fun swashbuckling adventure that even with it flaw capture your interest it must have felt a the big movie ever for the people who make it even if it make in the s it doesnt have a modern feel it more have the same feeling that a old errol flynn movie have big adventure movie be again the big thing in hollywood but im afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same a these old movie have this on the other hand just have the real feeling you just cant hate it i think it an okay adventure movie and i really love the soundtrack damn i want the theme song  n  the last hard men find james coburn an outlaw do a long sentence eaking free from a chain gang do he and his friend head for the mexican border from jail and safety no they dont because coburn have a mission of revenge to kill the peace officer who ought him in and in the process kill his woman that peace officer be charlton heston who be now retired and he know what coburn be after a he explain it to his daughter barbara hershey coburn be hole up in a shack and be involve in a waco like standoff his indian woman be kill in the hail of bullet fire it not something he proud of she be a collateral casualty in a manhunt lest we feel sorry for coburn he let u know full well what an evil man he truly be heston be his usual stalwart hero but the acting honor in the last hard men go to james coburn he blow everyone else off the screen when he on coburn get the ight idea of make sure heston trail him by kidnap hershey and take her to an indian reservation where the white authority cant touch him he know that heston have to make it personal then coburns gang include morgan paull thalmus rasulala john quade larry wilcox and jorge rivero heston have chris mitchum along who be his soninlaw to be the last hard men be one nasty and utal western andrew mclaglen direct it and im think it may have be a project originally intend for sam peckinpaugh it sure show a lot of his influence with the liberal use of slow motion to accentuate the violence of which there be a lot for a little peckinpaugh lite the last hard men be your film  n  maybe it be the title or the trailer certainly not the interview on the dvd which be with the director a he keep say hi kid into the camera like a buffoon but i have expectation for entrails of a virgin to be at least a bit of sleazy fun with some good sex scene and utal bloody killing by a weird japanese penetrator turn out it way too sleazy for it own good or bad or whatever theres a problem and one can see this also in the italian sexploitation flick porno holocaust similar to this in many respect in not have balance to the sex and violence too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movie and with the kill scene there have to be at least a little tack and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity in create the creature killer whatever entrails of a virgin have neither it safe to say it a pretty soulless movie even if isnt one of the very bad ever make it there just for horndog japanese fetishist to get off on girl in trouble and men who have all their ains in their other heads in this case be give a photo team where the guy be take some shot of some girl nothing too salacious and then by way of a dense fog they stay off at some house one night and be pick off one by one by a murderer a he credit first off the director kazuo gaira komizu decide he have to put in a quota of random sex scene early on we get splice in or phone in take your pick clip of one of the photographer have sex with one or more of the girl elsewhere it look like it from another movie then once settle into the house theres a wrestling scene thats poorly choreograph and shot yeah we really need to see him all there and then on to the rape and killing first the rape by the photographer who promise the girl some job for their time then the murderer who like damatos creature be simply cover in mud and give a stupid facial and who for an unknown reason kill the men and or rap the woman one by one now the latter of those take by themselves should be consider the highlight of the movie this be like say however that the cro    ton be the best part of a wretchedly tasting salad an eyegouging scene a spike thrown like an olympic event that scene actually be kind of cool and finally the entrailing of the overly sexcrazed girl whose inconsequential name i cant remember even  this  become disappointing just by not be correct to the title on top of this the sex scene which become tedious through gaira and his indulgence in longtakeswithoutcutaways where everything by the japanese censor be blur anyway be dub over by the actor youd think that they seem to be enjoy themselves enough hence the need to let them speak for themselves but the overall feeling from entrails of a virgin be that of a lumpy one where it just there to be gawk at and without a shred of suspense or true horror watch a the last girl leave alive the virgin of the picture try to stop the murderer from get to her which last five minute a she keep throw stick at him you just want it to be do with for the i hate woman mantra to ease up or be rid altogether  n  the few scene that actually attempt a depiction of revolutionary struggle resemble a hirsute boy scout troop meander tentatively between swim hole when sharif or please god palance try their hand at fiery oratory they sound like kurtz swallow a bug the display of strategic illiance incorporate a map of cuba replete with smile fishies in the ocean and a positively vaudevillian hypothesis on how the bay of pig come to pass what do that leave u with one comical dentistry scene a surfeit of uppity hollywood peasant who address the camera a though it be a move train and just for kick a passel of homoeroticism that be not limit to castros manic and unremitting cigarfellatio never trust a medved but even a busted clock be right twice a day this be a historically awful movie  n  this film take me by surprise i make it a habit of find out as little a possible about film before attend because trailer and review provide spoiler after spoiler all i know upon enter the theater be that it be a documentary about a long married couple and that imdb reader give it a rotten tomatoes user rank it at and the critic average an amazing if anything they underrate this little gem filmmaker doug block decide to record his parent for posterity and at the beginning of the film we be treat to the requisite interview with his parent outspoken mother mina and less than forthcoming dad mike i immediately find this couple interesting and have no idea where the filmmaker mike mina son doug be go to take u a a matter of fact i doubt that doug himself know where he be go with this life take unexpected twist and turn and this beautifully expressive film follow the journey it be difficult to verbalize just how move i be with this story and the unique way in which it be tell absolutely rivet from begin to end and it really be a mustsee even if you arent a fan of the documentary genre this film will make you think of your own life and might even evoke memory that you think be long forgotten birch street be one of those rare filmgoing experience that make a deep impression and never leave you the best news of all be that hbo have a hand in the production so instead of play to a limited art house audience eventually million of people will have a chance to view this incredible piece of work bravo  n  stephen hawking be a genius he be the king of genius watch this movie make me feel dumb but it a great movie not highly entertain but very very intrigue the movie center around wheelchair bound stephen hawking a man who make einstein look average and his theory and scientific discovery about the universe time the galaxy and black hole everyone at sometime or another during a really intense high come to a moment when they think theyv get the universe and the cosmos figure out and they swear as soon a they sober up theyll write it all down well here be a man who actually hold that feel for more then six hour here be a man who despite suffer from lou gehrig disease have become the great mind the world have yet see watch this and listen in on how he have formulate theory on black hole awesome you wont be the same after you see it  n  the story be about a psychic woman tory who return to her hometown and begin relive her traumatic childhood past the death of her childhood friend and abusive father tory discovers that her friend be just the first in a string of murder that be still occur can her psychic power help solve the crime and stop the continue murder you really dont need to find out because oh my god this be so so so so bad i know all the nora robert fan will flock to this movie and give it ton of s  then the rest of u will see an imdb score of and actually think this movie be worth watch but do not be fool the end be predictable the act terrible dont even get me start about the southern accent  yall  and the story be trite just remember      you be warn  n  oh god i must have see this when i be only or twelve dont ask how i may have be young but i wasnt stupid anyone could see that this be a bad movie nasty gross unscary and very silly ive see more impressive effect at disneyland ive see well performance at a school play and ive see more convincing crocodile at the zoo where they do nothing but sit in the water ignore the child tap on the glass the story be set in northern australia a handful of ambitious young people be try out a new water sport surf in shark fill water it soon become evident that something more dangerous be in the water after they learn what they get the help of a grizzly middle age fisherman who want to kill the animal to avenge the eating of his family i think i have see every crocodile film make in the last fifteen year the best of which be lake placid and the bad of which be it sequel blood surf would have to be the second bad croc flick i think with primeval and crocodile tail closely behind the australian saltwater crododile be one of the most dangerous creature out there result in more than a hundred injury or death every year movie like blood surf however ruin not only the ferocious image of such a creature but a good hour and a half of the viewer life unless you really want to see it avoid blood surf  n  fate lead walter sparrow to come in possession of a mysterious novel that have eerie similarity and connection to his life all base around the number a the story unfolds in real life and fiction sparrow must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end the number offer an intriguing premise that be undone by a weak execution the film just fail on many different level which be pretty disappointing because it hold so much potential the screenplay be probably the bad part about it it be fill with silly sequence and laughable dialog that just kill the mood of the movie it seem like the screenwriter have a good idea he just didnt know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute run time the second half of the film be run low on idea the twist be pretty obvious and the end be awful joel schumacher be responsible for one of the bad movie ever and he do redeem himself a little with phone booth and a few other film but the number remind me that he still capable of make a stinker he have the movie drench in style but he just cant get a good focus he move the film at a clunky and slow pace he switch from reality to whats actually happen in the book which quickly get annoy the actual book in the film thats title the number be an awful detective story and the audience get stuck listening to carrey narrate it which just bore me to tear when carrey be finally do with book we get stuck watch him run around try to solve the mystery at this point the audience have lose interest and there be no real tension we impatiently wait for the movie to reach it horrible end and unconvincing explanation before celeating that film have finally finished the acting be mostly average and pretty forgettable jim carrey be clearly just sleepwalk through his performance and he didnt even seem to be try he be either completely over the top in some scene or just very wooden his narration be a complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character virginia madsen do the best she could with a limited role but she need to pick good script logan lerman be pretty bland a be danny huston overall the number be an awful thriller that offer more laugh than suspense or thrill rating  n  we ought this film a a joke for a friend and could of be our bad joke to play the film be barely watchable and the acting be dire the bad child actor ever use and hasslehoff give a substandard performance the plot be disgraceful and at point we be so bored we be wonder what the hell be go on it try to be gruesome in place but be just laughable just terrible  n  this be probably the bad movie i have ever see in my life it be stupid there be no plot and the special affect be ridiculous and i have never see such bad acting in my life the only good part about the movie be all the hot guy especially draw full i dont know what these people be think when they make this movie i didnt even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guy be all in bed touch themselves i mean it be like some kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn i would advise anyone who have hear of this movie and be interested in see it to just forget about it and find another movie to watch i be very disappointed the whole movie be a complete waste of time in my opinion  n  this be a typical steele novel production in that two people who have undergo some sort of tragedy manage to get together despite the odds i wouldnt call this a spoiler because anyone who have read a steele novel know how they all end if you dont want to know much about the plot dont keep reading gilberts character ophelia be a woman of french decent who have lose her husband and son in an accident gilbert need to stop do film where she be require to have an accent because she otherwise a good actress can not realistically pull off any kind of accent brad johnson also an excellent actor be matt who be recover from a rather nasty divorce he be gentle convincing and compelling in this role the two meet on the beach through her daughter pip and initially ophelia accuses matt of be a child molester just because he talk art with the kid all of them become friend after this episode and then the couple fall in love the chemistry between the two lead be not great even though the talent of these two people be not in my opinion a question they do the best they could with a predictable plot and a script that border on stereotypical two people meet tragedy big tragedy a secret be reveal another tragedy and then they get together i wish there be more to it than that but there it be in a nutshell i want mindless entertainment and i get it with this in regard to the genre of romantic film this one fail to be memorable a secret affair with janine turner be far superior not a steele book a be some of steele earlier book turn into film  n  oh noes one of these attack of the japanese ghost girl movie     i dont even remember how many ive see maybe it sell     but not to me not scary at all the japanese horror movie be have be very similar since the first one of these     also the pulling of the kid i have see that pull under scene so many time in so many horror movie cellphone scene be also nothing new     the dramaticness of the guy get hit by a train kinda suck     i mean it lack all dramaticness     ok this be for kid who listen to japanese rock and think they be so unique     well let me tell you theres a million of you  d this be one of them ive see bad but you wont be miss anything by not see this  n  nicholas walker be paul the local town reverand who marry to martha ally sheedy but also be a habitual womanizer and decides to fake his own death to run away with his current affair veronica dara tomanovich however in so do he get a bout of amnesia hence the name of the film sally kirkland be also on hand a a crazy old coot who pin for the good reverand in a shade of misery type of way it sad to see a pretty good cast waste like this not the least bit john savage in a horridly forgettable role a a shoddy private investigator in a film bill a a black comedy one have to ing both element into say movie while this do ing the former in spade it sadly contain none of the latter furthermore you cant emphasize with any of the character and a thus have absolutely no vested interest in them technically not an alltogether bad movie just an extremely forgettable one eye candy dara tomanovich get topless sally kirkland also show some skin my grade c where i saw it showtime showcase  n  hollywood movie industry be the lazy one in the entire world it only need a single hit to flood theater with the same old crap reinvent over and over again take superheroes for example for each xman and spiderman there be daredevil elektra ghost rider and hulk japanese horror remake be even worst it only take the ring which be pitchperfect mostly because of mr  gore verbinsky to ing a ton of lookalike creepywoman base horror e g the ring the eye dark water which be fine but pointless and the grudges the first grudge wasnt entirely bad it be scary most of the way which be what one could expect from it plus the plot have some ains mix narrative grudge be exactly like the previous this could be a good thing but hey what boy men in black ii be it a nice thing to xerox the entire screenplay and just change the villain for the grudge the critic go the same way tired scare bad act except for amber tamblyn and clich  s all over the place three story take place on different place and time there be auey tamblyn investigate what drive her sister karen sarah michelle gellar to death allison arielle kebbel who be take by colleague to visit the house where the incident depict in the first movie take place and finally an american family that witness strange stuff happen on the apartment next door glad to say and i mean it that everything be tie up at the end but one must not rely on the end to make a good picture when everything else be simply tiresome and dull the chill be all over there a girl alone in the locker someone who shouldnt enter a house others that dig too deep meanwhile ghost keep kill and kill and kill which seem even more deadly than ten world war or the ebola epidemic hey doesnt that seem just like another bad japanese remake something call pulse yeah day after day it get easy to hold a grudge     against hollywood bullshit  n  down periscope have be in our liary since it first arrive in vhs since then we have acquire the dvd and a digital from cinema now it be a quirky flick that do not go militarily overboard a either pro or con it be first and foremost a comedy and a a vehicle for the main character i be quite surprised that a sequel have never be offered the movie have gain a follow that border on a cult obsession even among the very young i become aware of this while visit the uss drum in mobile alabama in a group of cub scout my grandson among them have all take up the role from the movie and plan to relive it during their overnighter on board it be a fun romp that make you proud both of our navy and hollywood     which be rare company thanks to kelsey grammar lauren holly and rob schneider for make what could have be an otherwise unremarkable movie such great entertainment  n  if you come here it because youve already see this film and be curious what others have to say about it i feel for you i  really  do and i profusely apologize a a canadian because thats what we do that this film ever have to cross your eye if only for a moment i hear there be no cure for the retinal bleeding report out of every dozen cases i like everyone else rent this movie believe it to be some stupid bmovie ripoff of blade i think sure i could use a good laugh at a stupid movie ill give the creator of this film one positive comment about their creation thanks for remove the rec xx xx xx from the bottom righthand corner of the screen i can see how that would have be a distraction from see this movie and for the record i  saw  the movie but do not watch it the dialogue be incoherent and most of the scene take place in my grandmother trailer i swear to god you know what im not write anymore about this it just too painful  n  deanna durbin nan grey and barbara read be three smart girl in this universal film from which introduces deanna durbin to film audience it also star ray milland mischa auer charles winninger john king binnie barnes and alice brady it a sweet story about three young woman now live in switzerland with their divorce mother who hear their father winninger be marry again not have see him in year and know their mother still love him they board a ship to america with the help of the housekeeper nanny determine to stop the wedding realizing that the intend call precious barnes be nothing but a golddigger aid and abet by her mother brady they arrange for her to be introduce to a wealthy count this be arrange by their father accountant king the man he choose be a fulltime drunk auer but the girl mistake him for an actual wealthy count milland what a mess this be a delightful film not cloy or overly sugary at all with some nice performance particularly by auer milland barnes and brady the young woman be pretty and all do good work the emphasis of course be on young durbin who be a natural actress and a beautifullytrained singer in fact her voice a a youngster be much more even than it would be a an adult she have no trouble with the high note a she do later on because she put too much weight in the middle voice she sing a delightful il bacio in a police station one of the nice thing about the film be to see the father play by charles winninger not want his child around until he see them and get to know them barnes a the golddigger isnt all that young but the girl mother look way up there so the inference probably be the old man seek his youth with a young more glamorous woman in fact he find the youth he be seek in his daughters universal give durbin the big star buildup here she have the final shot in the movie ray milland at this point be still pay his due and it will probably be a surprise even to film fan how young and attractive he is very entertain and of course this lead to a sequel and big stardom for deanna  n  if anyone be wonder why no one make movie like they use to with conversation character and a simple theme of friendship struggle to evolve into something new good and different those folk need to take in this film and see top notch write directing and act that meld into a wonderful evening of observation on how thing use to be in italy and england other day other time funnel into a terrific comedy of entertainment make in with alfred molina joan plowright polly walker josie lawrence jim broadbent miranda richardson and michael kitchen in the major role under the ush stroke direction of mike newell these actor accomplish vividly memorable performance that be photograph with a sublimely subtle painter eye reminiscent of the theatrical bedroom farce of the turn of the century this film might be call a friendship farce that become a worthwhile experience in the growth of the romantic nature within each character and the viewer too an artistic telegram on the importance of care about those around u  n  i watch this series out of curiositywanting to see if they could possibly and with all this modern technologyout do cecil b  demille classic epic of star charleton hestonyul brenner and sir cedric hardwicke of course i be let down yes they have all the biblical character correct but they didnt give u any of the spectacular theatrical scene that hold your interest throughout the first movie if you go to have a miniseries you have to have some rivoting scenes the burn bush part the red seadrowning pharohs army build sethis pyramid could have be do with today technology on the scale of blockbuster movie such a lord of the ring or the matrix obviously they didnt want to leave a lasting impression of faith and sacrifice which be much need in these trouble time  n  daniel daylewis be the most versatile actor alive english aristocratic snob in a room with a view passionate irish thief in in the name of the father an impudent violent butcher in gang of new york in a performance ten time strong than adrian brodys in the pianist and a the outrageous cristy brown with cereal palsy in my left foot just to name a few his role all influence eachother but each be seperate and utterly unique he change completely with each character he take on and im begin to believe that he can act a anything anything as cristy brown he be stun he do not ridicule the character and he do not pity the character a difficult achievement and cristy brown come to life a smart man an outrageous man human this movie despite small scenetransition fault and the like be an inspiration yes it predictable but be it stupidly sentimental no i laugh i cry not a single moment of cheese proof that this isnt a hollywood movie my favourite scene be the scene in the restaurant when cristy be discuss painter with eileen peter and her friend heres where daniel daylewis reach an act climax ill kick you in the only part of your anatomy thats animate wheel out the cripple and his performance never slow down never falter and be beautiful simply he have a lot of screen time here i watch it again again and i never get tire of cristys perspicacious eye twitch and guttural speeches a mustsee fo sho yo  n  my guess would be this be originally go to be at least two part and thus at least a quarter longer because otherwise how can one explain it confused abeviated storyline i be never completely lose but i be often partially lose and usually unclear on character motivation the movie feel a though joining plot point be drop to squeeze it into it time slot if it be long it might make more sense but it still wouldnt be much good the movie most interesting idea be of the war between zeus and hera a be a war between the male and female but the movie drop the ball on this make heras follower fairly horrible while not be clear on what zeus follower do or believe the movie be also interesting because you dont see the god and theres no real certainty that they exist so it get a couple of intrigue idea but it doesnt do anything useful with them bad dialog cardboard character and one interesting scene involve hercules and his three antagonistic son not unwatchable but also not worth watch  n  well i like to watch bad horror bmovies cause i think it interesting to see stupidity and unability of creator to shoot seriously good movie i always compare this movie to for example some spielberg work and againandagain dont understand the huge difference in what i see i like ed wood movie cause it so inept it very funny but people the chilling be not funny and be not even interest it extremely boring horror movie without anything what make even bad movie watchable theres no act no screenplay no direction no thrill and not even blood it extremely inept amateurish film it definitely the bad movie i have ever see and i have see a lot of bad movie believe me i warn you  n  this be the bad movie i have ever see as well a the bad that i will probably ever see i see no need to rehash what all the others have say previously just be forewarn     this be not one of those bad movie you think you want to watch because you want to be able to make fun of it it just plain bad bad bad bad bad this movie be the equivalent to have a pet rock a your friend you wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for something to happen unfortunately it never do at least with a pet rock you know what you be get into lion gate completely deceive on this bombshell     no     this be a disaster after watch this film you would swear george w  bush have his hand all over the making of this film     yes it that idiotic stay away unless of course you just want to watch the bad movie of all time it probably how lion gate figure it would make some money off this piece of tripe  n  i have be a mario fan for as long a i can remember i have very fond memory of play super mario world a a kid this game have ought back many of those memory while add something new super mario galaxy be the late installment in the amazing mario franchise there be much very different about this game from any other mario before it while still keep intact the great element of mario the first noticeable difference be that the story take place in space the story begin much like any other mario game mario receive a letter from princess peach invite him to a celeation at her castle in the mushroom kingdom upon arrive at peachs castle mario find bowser and his son bowser jr  attack the castle with their airship bowser kidnaps princess peach and then lift her castle up into space in the midst of the castle be lift into space mario fall off and land on an unknown planet mario be find by a talk star name luma and be take back to the lumas home a floating space station here mario meet many other lumas and also meet their leader a woman name rosalina rosalina tell mario that bowser have take away the space station power star and scatter them across the universe it be up to mario to help the lumas find them and save peach thus the adventure begins the way you play the game be by fly from the space station to other galaxy each galaxy consist of multiple planet that mario travel amongst in level via these shoot star to retrieve the power star mario can at many time walk all the way around planet without lose gravity some planet be small and others be big many planet be similar to classic mario environments the best thing about the game be the control all of the stuff like jump and such be still the same but the wiimote be use in many unique way in this game you shake the remote mario will perform a spin that be use a the primary attack in the game and it will as well activate the shooting star you can also point the remote at the screen and use the pointer to fire star bit at enemy or object in the environment then there be the graphic these be by far the best graphic on the wii it be just so hard to describe how great this game look you could probably almost say it look as good a some games my only minor gripe be that the go upside down effect take some get use to and also the story be pretty weak the bad part be that you lose all of your life when you turn off the game no matter how many you have when you last quit you restart at life still these minor problem aside it a superb game that be highly entertaining and be very challenge this be the type of game that weve be wait for on the wii a perfect out of  n  this short film that inspire the soontobe full length feature spatula madness be a hilarious piece that contend against similar cartoon yield multiple writer the short film star edward the spatula who after be fire from his job join in the fight against the evil spoon this premise allow for some funny content near the beginning but be barely present for the remainder of the feature this films minute run time be absorb by some oddball comedy and a small musical number unfortunately not much else lie below it the plot that be set up doesnt really have time to show but it surely follow it plot good than many highbudget hollywood film this film be worth watch at least a few time take it for what it be and dont expect a deep story  n  okay last night august th i have the distinct displeasure of meet mr  van bebble at a showing of the film the manson family at the three penny in chicago a part of the chicago underground film festival heres what i have to say about it first of all the film be an obvious rip off of every kenneth anger roman polanski oliver stone and terry gilliam movie ive ever see second of all in a short q a session after the show mr  van bebble immediately state that he never make any contact with the actual manson family member or charlie himself call them liar and say he want nothing to do with them that the film be base on his van bebbles take on the trial have see it all from his living room on tv and in the news and im assume from the autobiography and the book helter skelter which be directly mimic through the narrative so i have second dibs on question i ask if he be try to present the outsider mtv sex drug and rock n roll version and not necessarily the true story this question obviously piss off the by now slosh director who start shout f    you shut the f    up this be the truth all those other movie be bullsh   well anyway i didnt even think about how ridiculous this be until the next day when i read the tagline for the film youve hear the law side of the story     now hear the story a it be tell by the manson family excuse me if this guy have never even speak to the family and considers them to be liar that he doesnt want to have anything to do with how in god name can he tell the story for them this be the most ridiculous statement i have ever hear the film be obviously cater to the sex drug and rock n roll audience that it have no trouble in attract to the small dimly lit theatre and be even more obviously spawn by the sex drug and rock n roll mind of a man who couldnt even watch his own film without get up every ten minute to go get more beer or to shout some sort of rocky horroresque call line to the actor on screen this film accomplish little more than warp the public image of actual event which help shape the state of america and much of the world today into some sort of slasher comic book porno rape fantasy dream up by an obviously shallow individual the film be definitely very impressive to look at the soundtrack be refresh a it contain actual sample of charlies work with the family off of his lie album the editing be nice and choppy to simulate the nauseating uncertainty of most modern music video all in all this film would have make a much good addition to the catalogue at mtv than to the underground film festival or for that matter the mind of any intellectual observer i felt like i be at a midnight rocky horror view the way the audience be dress and behave probably the best part of the experience the cast be very good with the exception of charlie who resemble some sort of stoned dungeon and dragon enthusiast more than the actual role he be portray the description the film give of him a full of energy throw ten thing at you and be very physical about it all the while do not match at all the slow lethargic and chubby representation that be actually presented all in all the film basically explain itself a sadie or maybe it be linda declares at the end you can write a bunch of bullsh   book or make a bunch of bullsh   movie     etc etc case in point even the disclaimer base on a true story be a dead giveaway signal that somewhere beneath this psychedelic garbage heap lay the foundation of an actual story with content that will make and have make a difference in the world all you have to do be a little bit of alchemy to separate the truth from the the crap or actually maybe you could just avoid it all together and go read a book instead all i can say be this when the film end i get a free beer so im glad i go but not so glad i spent fifteen dollar on my ticket to be tell to shut the f    up for ask the director a question peace  n  i buy this game on an impulse buy from walmart i be glad i do it be very entertaining listening to sean connery and play the game i think the graphic be the best i have ever see in a movie game remake the bonus level be very hard the sniper one i think be too hard it make me so frustrated i didnt play the game for a week and a half there be too many people shoot at you with nothing to hide behind or life to handle it the only thing i might change be the upgrade system i didnt notice any difference from unupgraded equipment to the upgraded such a buy an armor upgrade didnt seem to make the armor strong or more filling on my life meter i really like the q copter i think the developer do a good job  n  no this hilariously horrible s madefortv horror clinker isnt about a deadly demonically possess dessert cake still this exceptionally awful yet undeniably amuse and thus enjoyable cathode ray refuse reach a eathtaking apex of absolute unremitting silliness and atrociousness thats quite tasty in a soexecrableitsdownrightawesome sort of way richard crenna look haggard and possibly ineiated and yvette mimieux who act a if she never get over the utal rape she endure in jackson county jail sluggishly portray a disgustingly nice and respectable suburbanite couple whose quaint dull sleepy small town existence get rip asunder when the cute german shepard they take in a the family pet turn out to be some ancient lethal evil spirit pretty soon mimieux and her two repellently cutesy kid kim richards and ike eisenmann the psychic alien moppet from the disney witch mountain picture be worship a crude crayon drawing of the nasty ugly canine entity in the den boy now doesnt that sound really scary and disturb well scary and disturb this laughably ludicrous claptrap sure aint but it sure be funny thanks to curtis night tide harringtons hopelessly weak direction cartoonish not so special effect an almost painfully risiblenridiculous plot and a game cast that struggle valiantly with the absurd story besides the lead both martine beswicke and r g armstrong iefly pop up a member of a satanic cult and victor jory have a nice cameo a a helpful native american shaman favorite scene the malicious mephestophelion mutt put the whammy on crenna practically force him to stick his hand into a wildly spin lawnmower blade while stuckup snobby fright film fan may hold their nose at the perfectly putrid stench of this admittedly smelly schlock devout tv trash lover should deem this endearingly abominable offal the boob tube equivalent to alpo  n  it be easy to tell early in this movie exactly what will happen and who will die it be about woman and a man who on a vacation this be make during the end of the ultra nazi seventy when blonde woman be supposedly ultra american survivor and unettes be all deserving of death this movie like the others of that era contrive to ing this about and the viewer know this there be no mystery or suspense the people squabble but everything be so predictable for the prejudice of the time it be laughable the five people happen upon two savage young character and go nuts everyone be nut so that the directorwriter team can justify their nazi propaganda for some reason the guy be attract to the blonde who be really not much to look at and ignore a super hot look unette that any heterosexual man would go nuts over one must remember that in the seventy movie be mean to appeal to woman and not men totally crap and totally depressing  n  marion davy star in this remarkable comedy show people release by mgm in davy play a hick from savannah georgia who arrive in hollywood with her father dell henderson the jalopy they arrive in be a hoot a be davy outrageous southern costume davy land a job in slapstick comedy not what she want but it ings her success she meet fellow slapstick star william haines who be immediately smitten with her well davy then get a job at a more prestigious studio high art studio and land a job in stuffy period piece a handsome but fake actor andre telefair show her the rope of how to be the typical pretentious hollywood star davy abandon her slapstick friend and father for the good life but of course learns that be not who she really be marion davy be wonderful throughout a she outrageously run the gamut of emotion require of a serious actress william haines be his usual wonderful comedic self and there be cameo by charles chaplin john gilbert and other famous star of the day include the director of the film king vidor this be a silent film with a few sound effect a sound picture be just come into their own a treasure of a film  n  the performance of every actor and actress in the film be excellently natural which be what movie acting should be and the directing skill be so illiantly handle on every detail that i be never tire of see it over and over again however i be rather surprised to see that this film be not include in some of the actor and director attenboroughs credit that puzzle me arent they proud of make a claim that they have make such excellent long lasting film for the audience i be hop i would get some answer to my puzzle from some one possibly one of the knowledgeable personnel insider of the film  n  while star trek the motion picture be mostly boring star trek the final frontier be plain bad in this terrible sequel the crew be on shore leave when they get a distress signal from the federation that ambassador represent earth romulus and kronos the klingon home world have be kidnap by a renegade vulcan bent on his quest to attain a starship to venture into the great barrier there he hop to find god use mysticism and bad writing he persuade many of the senior officer of the enterprise to betray kirk and get a hold of the ship they do reach the inside of the great barrier and find a planet where they do meet a godlike alien this one be so bad it be hard to figure out where to begin at the core be a good idea that be never really develop the plot go nowhere instead of where no man have go before it be almost like the writer have no idea how to end this fiasco the action scene dont have the suspense of wrath of kahn the philosophy be boring and the humor be stale now i will focus most of my anger on william shatner when he take the director chair the ego get big most of the focus be on him spock and mccoy but do not give the others enough to do moreover whereas shatner be usually guilty of overact in previous movie and television spot he be just plain bad in this one now kirk be reckless a practical joker and silly one of the bad scene involve the three leader sing the song row row row your boat in a round by a campfire in any case this be the bad of the star trek franchise i should have give it three out of ten instead of five  n  despite later claim this earlytalkie melodrama have very little in common with citizen kane it a biopic of a ruthless but human fictional plutocrat tell in flashback but hop around time the scriptwriter preston sturges show none of his late gift for sparkle dialog and none of the myriad cinematic innovation of kane be evident still it very watchable with a young spencer tracy his oldman makeup make him look just like well an old spencer tracy show depth and authority and colleen moore a little past her prime and not physically well match play a multifaceted womanbehindtheman there also helen vinson a one of the most treacherous femmes fatales in movie history send the final third into ecstatic soapopera reverberations the survive print be jumpy and have miss audio snippet and there be some plot hole leave open how would she know whose son it be if shes sleep with both of them and the music be awfully hokey for all that i be quite fascinated  n  this be the best version so far that you will see and the most true to the bronte work dalton be a little tough to imagine a rochester who jane eyre declare not handsome but his act overcomes this and zelah clark pretty a she be be also a complete and believable jane eyre this production be a lengthy watch but well worth it nearly direct quote from the book be in the script and if you want the very first true romance in literature this be the way to see it i own every copy of this movie and have read and reread the original the filming may seem a little dated now but there will never be another like this  n  apparently the people that write the back of the box do not bother to watch this socalled movie they describe blindingly choreograph intrigue and violence i saw no intrigue i instead saw a miserable attempt at dialogue in a suppose kung fu movie i saw no violence at least i saw nothing which could cause me to suspend my disbelief a to what could possibly hurt a man with impervious skinbut here i be perhaps reveal too much of the plot furthermore a a viewer of many and sundry film some of which include the occasional kung fu movie i can authoritatively say that this piece of celluloid be unwatchable whatever you may choose to do i will always remain correct jonathan tanner p s i be not blind by the choreography  n  i like boyle performance but thats about the only positive thing i can say everything be overdone to the point of absurdity most of the actor speak like you would expect your yearold nephew to speak if he be pretend to be a jaded stonehearted cop or an ultraevil villain the raspy voiceovers seem amateurish to me i could go buy a cheap synthesizer and crank out well open music and whats with the whole ish police torture stuff it be totally superfluous and have nothing to do with the actual event of the story cox add a lot of thing in fact that he apparently think would be really cool but have nothing to do with the story thats a big disappointment because one of the thing that make borges story so good be his minimalism they be tightly bind with no superfluous detail this movie be just the opposite i stop watch after the scene where lonnrot be question the guy from the yidische zaitung or thereabouts i waste rent this but at least i can get some satisfaction from write this review and hopefully save others from make the same mistake  n  it terrific when a funny movie doesnt make smile you what a pity this film be very boring and so long it simply painfull the story be stagger without goal and no fun you feel well when it finish  n  so well make no cgi crap have anyone else be on the jumping crocs tour of darwin adelaide river before black water be way realistic rogue be a bit cringeworthy thought the blonde chick be excellent in it havent really see her before and the other chick be a babe she be always excellent v  suspenseful i would compare it to jaw over any other man eat animal flick get the hole aussie thing down pat without go ott with struths and crikeys as well love it  n  the assignment be an outstanding thriller with several plot twist drive by character rather than star turn the need to stage special effect obligatory romance and endless car chase however there be a car chase in here and a dandy it be aidan quinn be wonderful a both the terrorist and the naval officer recruit to eliminate him it be rare that a second or third tier actor such a quinn be give an important starring role like this that carry a film usually such a role be give to an alist actor with box office draw which be probably why i never heard of this film before i saw it donald sutherland be great a the morally ambiguous somewhat creepy at time agent that recruit quinn ben kingsley be fine also a the israeli agent the plot be very complex and there be multiple story line which converge in gradual fashion toward the end and not all at once a be use to see the paranoia and claustrophobia of these type of thriller be capture and portray with both moral ambiguity and frighten intensity the location be convince and effective the soundtrack be nothing special but rarely do we get all of the above mention quality these day without dumb and or meaningless plot development unconvincing star turn loud annoy music video type soundtracks a villain that ham it up and repeatedly a cast costume and plot that cater mostly to an audience under this be an outstanding thriller which most assuredly do not get it just due upon it release      of star  n  this be one of the fine movie i have ever see      the stark scenery     the isolation     the ignorant bigoted people hide behind their religion     a backdrop for some wordliness and sophistication     the acting be completely natural     but for me a afoodie the best be the actual choosing and preparation of the feast  i have spend time in paris and know the cuisine well     whether or not the cafe anglais really exist i dont know but i do know of similar establishment and babettes menu and choice of wine be authentic     and of course the end where despite themselves the perfect meal mellow them back to friendship be the only end there could be  this be a out of film and should be see by anyone with enough ain and taste to understand it  n  set in the the second year of the french republic form after the execution of louis xvi this film portray the power struggle between the revolutionary leader danton gerard depardieu at his fine and robespierre a commanding performance by the polish actor wojciech pszoniak the moderate revolutionary danton have return to paris from his country seat where he have be since be depose a leader of the committee of public safety in the previous year by robespierre he be oppose to the reign of terror which have result in the execution of thousand of citizen mainly by guillotine who be think to be oppose to the revolution danton be confident of the support of the ordinary people and try to persuade robespierre to curb the bloodletting but robespierre and the committee be afraid that the popularity of danton will lead to them be overthrow and put danton and his supporter on trial for be traitor this be the first french language film make by andrzej wajda after he have arrive in france from poland his polish film company be close down by the government due to his support for the solidarity trade union which have oppose the polish government in the late seventy and early eighty his previous film man of iron have deal with the solidarity union and it leader lech walesa and it be easy to draw comparison between the relationship of walesa and the polish leader general jaruselski and that between danton and robespierre danton walesa be the voice of reason oppose to robespierre jaruselski who continue dictatorial rule despite have lose the support of the people they claim to represent the film be base on the polish play the danton affair write by stanislawa przybyszewska in the s and on it release the film be criticise by some for be static and theatrical but what the film do be to concentrate on the behindthescenes meeting of the committee and the scene in the national assembly and the courtroom rather than the activity on the street of paris  n  usually im a bit of a fan of the bad eighty early ninety film feature now have beens     but this film be so incredibly terrible that it be a real endurance test to sit through guy dress up a girl have be do to death but never so pathetically corey haims performance be abysmal a usual nicole eggert be not much well this have no redeeming quality even if you be a number fan of an actor actress in this piece of trash stay away  n  i have now see quite a few film by pedro almod  var but this would have to be the most disappointing so far this film seem to lack the zaniness that be usually everywhere in his film and the story just never get me interested many almod  var regular appear in this film so it not like there be a lack of onscreen talent but this film just seem more serious than his other film if there be a comedic edge to this movie i certainly couldnt find it and it make for one surprisingly weak movie  n  i greatly enjoy margaret atwoods novel the robber bride and i be thrill to see there be a movie version a woman frame a cop boyfriend for her own murder and his buddy an excop journalist try to clear his name by check up on the dead woman crazy female friends it fortunate that the movie script fix ms  atwoods clumsy plot by focus on the story of these two men victim of scheme woman     heh okay you get me if these guy be mention in the book and im pretty sure theyre entirely make up for the movie ill eat the dust cover of my hardback copy apparently the three main female character of the novel arent enough to carry the movie zenias manipulation arent interest unless we see them happen to a man and a mans life be screw up roz chari and toni tell their story to a man because it not important if a man doesnt hear them i like the character in the book it hurt to see them push off to the side for a mans story i normally do not look for feminist angle on medium and i try to enjoy the movie a be if i hadnt read the book i might have enjoy the movie a lot more so if you like the cop and the excop and you want to read more about them youre out of luck read the novel if you want to enjoy luscious prose and characterization subtly layer through a plot it the same plot the movie excavate it iron it and sprinkle it with male angst it like zenias revenge on margaret atwood  n  this movie get a because there be a lot of gore in it who care about the plot or the acting this be an italian horror movie people so you know you cant expect much from the acting or the plot everybody know fulci take footage from other movie and add it to this one since i never see any of the movie that he take footage from it didnt matter to me the italian godfather of gore out do himself with this movie this be one of the gory italian movie you will ever see no gore hound should be without this movie in their horror movie collection buy this movie no matter what it be a horehounds dream come true  n  ingrid bergman play dentist walter matthaus faithful receptionist who harbor a little crush on her bos be absolutely wonderful in this film she handle the witty repartee in the script with aplomb and steal a terrific scene where she and goldie hawn talk in a record booth ingrids monologue be a front but her face tell you she believe in it with all her heart matthau be an odd choice for the lead man he too old for goldie hawn and too unrefined for bergman not to mention too unfocused to be a dentist but i like the way he try hard to please goldie and stumble around try to free himself from a lie hawn who win a supporting oscar be just a fresh and bubbly a she be today this bedroom farce isnt terribly sophisticated and faintly remind one of any wednesday besides but it a welcome relief from the noisy teenoriented comedy they turn out today cactus flower be a lovely sigh     from       n  a bored television director be introduce to the black art and astral projection by his girlfriend learn the ability to separate his spirit from his body the man find a renew interest in his life and a sense of wellbeing unfortunately the man discovers while he be sleep his spirit leave his body and his uncontrolled body roam the street in a murderous rampage accord to the dvd sleeves synopsis the synopsis isnt entirely correct a it turn out anyway the movie open with a dizzy outofbody example of handsome director winston rekert a paul sharpe s newly discover astral body experience it also foreshadow an upcoming dogfight young andrew bednarski a matthew sharpe be a kid draw picture of the blue man a his murder spree begin handsome detective john novak a stewart kaufman discover the victim be connect to mr  rekert mr  novaks investigation lead to the supernatural a prime example of which be karen black a janus with whom rekert fear he be fall in love several in the cast perform well but the blue man wind up tie itself up in a knot aka eternal evil it unsatisfying story try to be far too clever for it own good  n  ah yes the s a time of reaganomics and sly chuck and a host of other action star hide in a remote jungle blow away commie at the time i couldn t believe how movie like rambo miss in action and uncommon valor and who can forget the ridiculous red dawn make money at the box office they re turgid action crap fests with a rather off put right wing agenda and they have date very badly troma s war be a tongue in cheek take on these type of movie but you ve get to ask yourself do they need spoof in the first place of course not troma s war lack any sort of sophistication though it do make the point that there s no real difference between right wing tyrant and leave wing one and sometimes feel more like a grade z movie than a send up maybe it be  n  this tale base on two edgar allen poe piece the fall of the house of usher dance of death poem be actually quite creepy from begin to end it be similar to some of the old blackandwhite movie about people that meet in an old decrepit house for example the cat and the canary the old dark house night of terror and so on boris karloff play a demented inventor of lifesize doll that terrorize the guest he die early in the film or do he and the resident of the house be subject to a number of terrify experience i wont go into too much detail here but it be definitely a mustsee for fan of old dark house mysteries watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened room dan basinger  n  i be so happy and surprise that there be so much interest in this movie jack frost be my introduction into the film produce and distribute by apix entertainment and without exception everything this company deal with be pure crap first and this be very important never ever watch this movie sober why would you unlike many other entertaingly bad movie this one i feel be make intentionally bad i just cant get over how fake the snowman be which be why it always show only iefly the way it move be the best this movie be waaaaaaaaaaay good than the michael keaton piece of crap becuz that be make too be a good movie and that version be as bad a this  n  revolt of the zombie prove that have the same director revamp and recycle an idea doesnt necessarily make lightning strike twice the halperin others responsible for the horror classic white zombie make this trite piece of garbage a mere few year later to cash in on it popularity and even recycle closeup of lugosis eye from that previous film there be a court battle with the white zombie film right owner who didnt want the halperins to be able to use the word zombie in this title that word be the only thing that could help this film because a everyone know bad film can make much more money simply by have the word zombie appear in the title know what victor halperin be capable of a few year before only make this uninteresting film more insulting it seem he never direct another horror film after this debacle the zombie here seem not to be true walk dead but simply hypnotism victims     wan na create a mindcontrolled army of zombie be ready to crack a few egg include your own the lame plot man fall in love with scheme woman who play with his heart and becomes engage to him only to make his friend whom she love jealous this send man into a spiral of madness in which he try use zombie mindcontrol technique to change thing to his advantage in an attempt to win over a woman who isnt worth spit this include one of the most blatantly obvious plot development ive ever see youd have to be blind or stupid not to see the end come the act isnt even good this movie make the racially insensitive king of the zombie which appear on the same double bill dvd i buy seem like an atmospheric horror masterpiece by comparison and remind u that not every black and white film be a classic it make the atomic age scifi alien zombie cheese fest invisible invader seem like a serious drama this be one big ball of cheese so ridiculously melodramatic it could probably make many a korean film fan twitch south korean film be often know for their use of melodrama the credit list the ironically name company favorite film im not sure whose favorite film this would be but theyre obviously an idiot not recommend for fan of zombie romance or classic film  n  the complaint be valid to me the big problem be that this soap opera be too aim for woman i be okay with these night time soap like grey anatomy or ugly betty or west wing because there be story that be interest even with the give that they will never end however when the idea parallel the daytime soap aim at just put hunky men taye diggs tim daly and chris lowell into sexual tension and romp and numerous ridiculous difficult situation in a socalled little hospital it seem like general hospital     or a female counterpart to baywatch that be what men want and they have it so if this be what woman want so be it but the idea that this be a high ow show or something men will watch be unrealistic  n  this movie be one of the best movie that i have see this year i didnt see any cameo in the movie but it be still pretty good it be similar to anchorman in the humor department but i think this be a good put together movie it actually have a point if you be go to see a whole bunch of t a you will be disappoint just a well put together movie if you have nothing to do for the day or you need a lot of humor you will find this to be a really good movie i definitely think that ebert and roepers review of this movie be right on i mean i dont really like ebert on most movie but this be the movie that i will agree about the movie contain a good enough story that it be actually believable that these type of people be out there there be definitely something to be say about how they treat virginity in this movie yea sure you get laugh at when it be find out about but it still suggest that you wait steve do a wonderful job of portray the person that he do in this movie and yet it be still funny  n  i remember see this film in the mid s think it a well pace and well acted piece i now work quite often in berkeley square and the have to get a copy of dvd to remind myself how little the area have change although my office be newish it just second away from the bank even jack barclays car dealership be still there sell bentleys and roll royces its look like the dvd be due a region release soon the region copy i be very poor quality let hope theyve clean it up only the slightly dodgy escape sequence from the court spoil what would otherwise be a great film but i guess be in line with the caper tag the film go with  n  two hour ago i be watch this illiant movie which overwhelm me with it imprison photography it be quite understandable how it win the prize of best camera in cannes close ups predominate it close ups of wall human and of many other thing the warm color light which be also usually by the director give the movie a warm atmosphere only two person be principally to be see in most of it an interesting music and especially three song or theme accompany the movie nearly all the time each one of these theme represent a certain atmosphere during the whole movie silence and slow movement characterize the movie some scene be extended moment or a serious of closeup not only tony leung deserve a prize for his superb act since maggie cheung be also so illiant i wonder how many dress she be wear in the different scene the story be also connect somehow with the history of hong kong and the region the s  this prevent me from understand some detail of the it especially at the end in short i would recommend the fan of artistic movie to watch it in the cinema  n  luckily for bill murray this be such a lightweight project since he pretty much have to carry it meatballs be the story of lowrent camp northstar and how it counselor deal with the camper as well a one another then there be much make of their wealthy rival from across the lake name camp mohawk which culminate in a twoday olympiad competition above it all be bill murray clown around and make a pretty memorable film debut the film be sprinkle with mediumsized laugh chuckle and more than a few guffaw along the way the big laugh come from the prank play on the nerdy camp director three of them involve the counselor move his bed outside in various location while he sleep morty or micky a everyone call him wake up along the side of a road strung up in some tree several foot above the ground and finally float on a raft in the middle of the lake there be also some funny moment involve the counselor hit on one another but this be a pg rat film with little in the way of raunchiness the film take a serious note involve a shy camper name rudy who be play by chris makepeace of course it up to murray to teach the kid how to open up and give him the confidence he need to run a marathon during the olympiad the sentimentality of rudys situation seem tack on to a great degree notice how when murray first see the kid sit alone in the grass after get off the bus he tell him you must be the short depressed kid we order make you wonder if that line be really in the script or murray be just adlibbing while the camera be roll in other word murray might as well have say to makepeace you must be that actor we hire to play the stereotypical lonely kid you see in most summer camp film who doesnt fit in but before it all over murray performance make this plot device more than bearable he really seem to have some good chemistry with makepeace the film culminates with the game between the two rival camp very little of the event we be show be even slightly believable but it just doesnt matter this be a pretty good film on many level dont let the absurd rating this film be currently get scare you off murray will keep you laugh throughout just be warn        avoid the sequel especially the one with corey feldman of stars the hound  n  the danish bladerunner be boldly state on the box be you kid me this film be a complete drag when im thirsty and go for a soda in the kitchen i usually pause the vcr so i wont miss anything not this time i actually find myself look long and hard in the fridge just so i wouldnt have to go back why the hell be there not one sciencefictionscriptwriter out there who have the vague clue about how computer work it mindboggling one of the premise of film be that our hero whos a hacker have a little computerassistant to help him the microsoft office paperclip finally catch on in the future when he lose the assistant in the movie hes helpless and cant get into any computer hes a hacker it like say that you cant drive your car if you dont have your lucky drivingcap on i wont even go into the lightningeffect when he recieves electroshock      n  this movie show a clip of live animal mutilation of an animal get hack by a machete and get it skin rip off i know these horrible thing happen in the world but im watch movie base on the fact that what im watching be not actually happen on the screen these live animal clip be not mean to be in movie they be mean to show people that belong to certain organization to help the horrible thing that human to do other species this should be ban and destroy i have also contact netflix and other resource to collaborate get this movie off the market this movie should be remove from the public the person who make this movie need psychological help  n  anyone who think kool moe dee carol alt and corey feldman comprise a list of good actor must be smoke something id love to try sometime where to begin lousy soundtrack hammy act action in place this be the typical amateurishly write hack fodder that washedup hasbeen and neverwass love to star in i actually felt embarrass for the star in this film the only thespian miss to top this turd be gary coleman who if he would have be in the movie would have make it at least somewhat howlingly bad rather than just plain bad there be one part in the film where carol alt scream do you think im an idiot yes carol i do your agent do and please for the love of all that be decent and holy     go away and stop degrade yourself like this this film be something anna nicole smith would take part in i would tell you what the plot be but that would be one more sentence fragment to this article plus my mind drift many time during the movie anyway so i barely pay attention  n  this film could have be a decent remake and gosh know it try or ms  english try assemble talented actor together with a successful experienced writer director should be a formula for a decent film but ms  english experience accord to her imdb bio be exclusively limit to television work and it be glaringly obvious throughout this film i be surprise that none of the review i have read mention what i find most unlikeable about this film and what keep it from reach even a portion of it potential it look and felt like it be make for television to give some credit to ms  english many of the joke that simply do not work on a movie screen would have be terrific on tv and maybe a laugh track would have help so much of the camera usage and the lighting would have play out fine on tv but look awkward or odd on a big screen if the whole film have be chop up into a miniseries or a sitcom i think it could have work but this be cinema and sadly ms  englishs talent didnt translate i cringe at so many different point in my embarrassment for the actor the writer that i felt like i come out of the theater half shrivel meg ryan be her usual perky cute self except for the awful plastic surgery she have have on her face but where do she have a chance to use her talent she have make film where she doesnt recreate her stereotyped role and do them well     but not here annette bening seem to simply go through the motion such a great talent and yet such a poor performance i enjoy the other woman character but they be more caricature than substance and it be sad to see what work in this film in the s doesnt translate to the s and no one help ms  english get the change update or subtlety right if only she a writer director and producer have reach out for some assistance i think it could have be good but it be not its so frustrate to go to a movie that have good star and a good writer or director and come away feel it be a waste of everyones time money this new yorker cartoon i saw yesterday be appropriate a few movie exec be have a meeting the caption read let remake a classic with bad everything  n  i find it very intrigue that lee radziwill jackie kennedy sister and the cousin of these woman would encourage the maysles to make big edie and little edie the subject of a film they certainly could be consider the skeleton in the family closet the extra feature on the dvd include several contemporary fashion designer credit some of their idea to these oddball woman id say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these designer fascinate i e be they nut or be i miss something this movie be hard to come by netflix do not have it facets do though  n  cmon guy some previous reviewer have nearly write a novel comment on this episode it just an old s tv show this episode of star trek be notable because of the most serious babe yeoman barrows ever use on star trek and the fact that it be film in a real outdoor location unlike the tng and voyager series which be totally confine to sound stages this use of an outdoor location and babe give proper depth and an almost film like quality to a quite ordinary episode of this now dated and very familiar show except a few notable exception i e the city on the edge of forever assignment earth and tomorrow be yesterday the old series of star trek need to be seriously mothball and put out of it boring misery half a dozen good episode from be quite a poor batting average this be typical of the boring stuff gene roddenberry produce back then actually contrary to popular belief where some people worship the ground he walk on he actually make a lot of rubbish he doesnt deserve to be speak of in the same eath a irwin allen for example just look at the set of the idge of the enterprise from a modern point of view they use wobbly plywood for the floor cafeteria chair with plastic back and cheap cardboard above the instrument panel you can clearly see the fold in the paper every expense spar or what  n  i just watch this movie on it premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia i like not love mork mindy a a kid mostly for robin williams zany energetic performance this movie make me remember why be the original show great not really but robin certainly be which ings me to this movie i be pleasantly surprised expect nothing more than a paint by number chronological retelling of the show which in a way it be but of course the real focus be on robin it be interest to see robin journey from struggle street jester to national t v star and how such a drastic difference affect him and his long suffering wife and my hat be off to star chris diamantopoulos a he portray mr  williams with integrity sensitivity and heart not just a cute impression although it be even deadon on an unrelated note i notice that robin struggle be in some way similar to andy kaufman who be underappreciated by network t v and hold back creatively but thats the taxi behind the scene biopic all in all this be a very enjoyable flick in which i felt i get to know a little more of the man behind the orkan the acting be solid by all never melodramatic like i suspect and the story move along well performance that be particularly good be by those who play garry marshall and john belushi the scene in which belushi heckle robin be a hoot not a great masterpiece by any mean i would have like to have see a tad more about pam dawber but definitely watchable especially for those robin williams and mork mindy fan out there nanoo nanoo  n  i catch this film on azn on cable it sound like it would be a good film a japanese green card i cant say ive ever dislike an asian film quite the contrary some of the most incredible horror film of all time be japanese and korean and i be a huge fan of john woos hong kong film i an not adverse to a light hearted film like tampopo or chung king express two of my favourite so i thought i would like this well i would rather slit my wrist and drink my own blood than watch this laborious badly act film ever again i think the director steven okazaki must have spike the water with quaalude because no one in this film have a personality and when any of the character do try to act a opposed to mumble a line or two their performance come across a forced and incredibly fake i honestly do not think that anyone have ever act before     the only person who sound genuine be brenda aoki   i find it amaze that this be promote a a comedy because i didnt laugh once even more surprising be that cbs morning news call this a refreshing eath of comedy it be neither refresh nor a eath of comedy and the end be very predictable the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think such things avoid this film unless you want to see a boring predictable plot line and wooden acting i actually think that spike of bensonhurst be a well act film than this     and i walk out half way through that film  n  before i begin let me get something off my chest im a huge fan of john eyre first film project shadowchaser the film a bgrade cross of both the terminator die hard may not be the work of a cinematic genius but be a hugely entertaining action film that become a cult hit spawn two sequel a spin off  judge and jury begin with joseph meeker a convict killer who be send to death row follow his capture after the socalled bloody shootout which seem like a poor name for a killing spree    meeker kill three people while try to rob a convenience store be lead to the electric chair there be an amusing scene where meeker talk to the priest about living for sex but meet his one true love who be kill during the shootout express his revenge for the person who kill her    michael silvano a washedup football star who spend his day watch his son alex practice football with his high school team and end up harass his son coach but once execute meeker return a a revenant or a kelly perine call a hamburger without the fry whose sole aim be to get his revenge which basically mean make silvanos life a misery let me point out the fact that judge and jury be not a true horror film it be a supernatural action film with meeker chase silvano use his ability to change form which amount to david keith dress up a everything from an elvis impersonator a french chef with an accent as bad a his moustache a drag queen a clown a standup comedian a shotgun which fire explosive round an invulnerability to death although that doesnt stop martin kove from shoot keith with a desert eagle to pay silvano back for kill meekers wife director john eyre do not seem interested in characterisation instead focus solely on action scene which the film have plenty of but that be the film main flaw since there nothing to connect the action scenes together the acting be surprisingly good with keith deliver the best performance support ably by kove as well a paul koslo who play the washedup cop quite well kelly perine be annoy a the cabbie who try to help but make the situation worse  n  ye lous film purple butterfly pit a secret organization purple butterfly against the japanese force in war torn shanghai ding hui zhang ziyi and her exlover hidehiko itami toru nakamura find themselves on opposite side of the conflict after a chance meeting i agree with the reviewer from paris the film substitute a convoluted semihistorical conflict for a plot without give the audience a single reason to care about the character or their cause the sudden time shift doesnt help matter a it appear completely unwarranted and pointless normally i dont mind dark movie but the absence of light the bonejarringly shaky camera footage and the generally bad filmmaking technique really make this a tough film to watch and stay interested in i also agree with the viewer from georgia that this film have a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography but i dont think that help the movie the backdrop to the film be one of the most potent event of the th century and i dont believe you can do it any justice by edit it a if it be a michael bay film the overly melodramatic moment dont add to it watchability the actor be all suitably melancholy zhang ziyi once again show that she have an exceptionally limited act range a she spend the entire movie do what she seem to do best in all her film ooding and look generally annoy however at least she add some variety to this role by chainsmoking and engage in the bad lovemaking scene since michael biehn and linda hamilton in the terminator all in all a very disappointing film especially see a how it come from the director of suzhou he  n  after hear about george orwell prophetic masterpiece for all of my life im now but never have read the book i be totally confused a to what ive just seen i be very familiar with the concept cover in the novel a im sure most be but only through hearsay and quote without this limited knowledge this film would have be a complete mystery and even with it im still no more educate about the story of than i be before i watch it on the plus side     the cinematography be amazing hurt burton deliver fine performance and the overall feel of the movie be wonderfully grim and desolate the prostitute scene be a fantastically dark piece of film making now for the down side and there be plenty     there be a war go on at least as far a the propaganda be concern but why with who nothing be explain there be a couple of name bandy about eurasia etc but they mean nothing without explanation who be winston what do he do where do he come from where do he work why be he change news report why isnt he on the front line why doesnt he eat the food in the canteen what be that drink hes drink through the entire film why be he so weak ill why isnt he ainwashed like the rest of them whats the deal with his mother sister what happen to his father a little back story would have be nice no scrub that essential for those like myself that havent read the book without it this be just a confusing and hard to follow arthouse movie that constantly keep you guess at what be actually go on the soundtrack be disjoint and badly edit and the constant chatter from the big brother screen swamp the dialogue in place make it even hard to work out whats go on i accept that this may have be an artistic choice but it very annoy all the same also i know this have be mention before but why all the nudity it just seem totally gratuitous and felt like it have be throw in there to make up for the lack of any plot coverage i personally cant abide the way hollywood feel it have to explain story line word for word these day we be not all ainwashed simpleton but this be a few step too far the other way i can only imagine that it totally rely on the fact that youve read the book because if this film really be the literal translation that ive see many people say i would find it very hard to understand why be hail a the classic it is theres no denying that it be light year ahead of it time and have pretty much predict every change in our society to date maybe this have be a sort of bible to the power that be but many scifi novelist have do the same without leave gap hole in the storyline i guess i have to do what i should have do from the start and buy a copy of the book if im to make any sense out of this all in all very disappointed in something ive wait for year to watch  n  this cute animate short feature two comic icon betty boop and henry henry be the bald slightly portly boy from the comic who never speaks well here he do speak he want to get a puppy from betty boops pet store and when he be leave to mind the store some hilarious hijinks ensue betty sings a song about pet henry get in a battle with bird and a monkey but everything work out in the end  n  i just get back from this free screening and this osama witch project be the handsdown worst film ive see this year bad than even catwoman which have the decency to at least pass itself off a fiction in september tap a film crew of documentary journalist head to afghanistan despite be thoroughly unprepared for the trip the condition and oh yeah the psychotic and ridiculous vendetta of their filmmaker leader to avenge his wifes death on sept  to track down osama bin laden they make eight tape on their journey which now document their travel and of course their attempt to kill the terrorist leader the eight tape thankfully all end at point significant in the narrative which be convenient for a documentary the psychotic idiotic protagonist who be give to long significant speech that he probably learn watch macgyver care nothing for his own life or the life of his innocent crew a he get them far and far into danger through a series of completely dumb mishap i dont know why he didnt just wear a sign on his back that say shoot me the crew translator supposedly their sensible voiceofreason do little more than whine and get baffle a the idiot hero lead them into doom you wish theyd ought along someone on their trip to call them all morons around tape i begin root for the terrorist to shoot the film crew  n  i remember see this film in the theater in when i be yearsold you do the math i absolutely love it i be tarzan for the week after see it climb the furniture jump around make monkey sound it start a fascination with tarzan and monkey but oddly enough a longer lasting love for christopher lambert keep in mind that i saw highland very shortly after this be the last time i saw that film until about a month ago it happen to be on cable a i be get ready for bed at be and even though it be late and i be tire and i have to be at work at be i stay up to watch this movie that i love a a kid upon view it i realize that it be not that great of a film and even odd then that that andie macdowell voice be dub by someone else ian holme be of course solid a usual and surprisingly the monkey suit still kind of hold up but what be most surprising be how good lambert be a tarzan he be great the depth he manage to capture in so few line his primal body language and most importantly his ability to ing this character through it extremely large ark be just amazing as i state earlier i be lambert fan but im use to highlander the hunted and fortress in this film he be really quite good and it be a shame that he never get a chance to portray a character with such depth again so to make a short story way too long i be a little disappointed that the film be not that good but i be glad to see that lambert be good and i do not regret stay up until be to see it  n  a family be travel through the mid west theres widower ben charles bateman his girlfriend nicky ahna capri and bens little daughter k t geri reischl then hit a town name hillsboro where everyone act more than a little strangely their car eaks down and theyre force to stay they soon find out a witch coven have a spell over the town and be up to incredible evil the story be not that good people just figure thing out of nothing and they just happen to find out where the witch be at the end also there be a lot of loophole leave dangle at the end the acting be pretty poor too bateman and capri be bland and everybody else be about the same only old pro strother martin and l q jones give good performance still this movie do work it forgoes blood and gore there some but this be pg and mange to work with some very creepy visuals and atmosphere the acting hamper a lot of it but it still work martin especially chew the scenery in his role i cant explain exactly why i sort of like this movie but it do work on me it a quiet kind of horror that isnt make anymore hardly a masterwork but this deserve to be

young year be behind her we learn little about this woman marriage except that she have be feel her independence slip away a of late shes also recently learn shes pregnant which have far complicate

conventional term some scene such a knight first call home from a payphone or her first night alone with caan where they play simon say be almost too intimate to watch coppola toy with reality turn the jagged memory of his character into scrapbook weve be make privy to he allow scene to play out yet the editing be quite nimble and the film be never allow to get too heavy there be at least two or three very frisky moment it a heady endeavorso much so that the picture be still be show at festival nearly five year later some may shun coppola unapologetic twisting of event in order to underline the finale with bitter irony however the forcefulness and drive behind the picture nearly obliterate it shortcoming     from       n  this movie be not very well direct they almost totally disregard the book i guess they be try save time the only upside me be that the actor who play finny be cute some of the dialog between the main character appear a little gay which be not the case in the book major part of the book be once again chop out you lose the over all effect it be not as haunting a the book and leave me lack severely also the strong language although it be ief be very unnecessary also i be surprise not pleasantly by a new character that be no where in the book one of my favorite character leper be poorly interpret and portray he seem more sinister in the movie than the real leper be in the book over all disappointing  n  the buzz for this film have always be about the fabulous graphic that make kevin bacon disappear sadly they stop there they should have continue to make the script disappear then the silly set and finally every visible element of this film because there nothing else there to show gary thompson and andrew marlowe be list a the write credit for this film i dont really think they exist i think they buy this script at scriptsrus where you buy a standard blank monster movie script and just fill in the blank theres a monster stalk u let split up they

even the minimum number of element that be specific to an invisible man movie ir glass spray with something like paint be handle badly what be sad be that there be lot of possibility for this to be a fascinating movie they psychological issue for the subject the deterioration of the mind due to the process treat an invisible subject and many other idea be touch on for usually less than second and would have be far more interesting have there be any desire to save kevin bacon in the end it would have be a much good movie all in all it stunk i would mention some of the incredibly stupid element of the end of the movie but i dont want to do any spoiler suffice it to say that these character be so stupid they dont think about pull the plug on a machine rather than      n  a young girl become a

richard gere emran that of olivier and malikka the perfect cheat wife role of lane they have change the second half of the film to adapt for the indian mass even then the movie have get the full trace of unfaithful though it couldnt catch up with the original it be a cheap soft porn of the bollywood lover where mallika show a lot more skin than anyone dare to show emran do more role like this and be even nickname the serial killer in the future if the indian director plan to remake a english movie then they have to look into the feasibility of the plot with the indian censor though the film bomb at the box office the actor get the undue recognition in future the director should be a little more careful in remake a oscar nominate film all say this be not a family film so take the extra caution while watch it at home with family  n  robert altmans downbeat newfangled western from edmund naughtons book mccabe be overlook at the time of it release but in the past year have garner a sterling critical follow aside from a completely convincing boomtown scenario the character here dont merit much interest and the picture look intentionally ackish and unappealing bearded warren beatty play a turnofthecentury entrepreneur who settle in struggle community on the outskirt of nowhere and help organize the first othel once the profit start come in beatty be naturally menace by city tough who want part of the action altman create a solemn wintry atmosphere for the movie which give the audience a certain sense of time and place but the action in this sorry little town be limitedmost of the story be make up of vignettesand altmans pace be deliberately slow there hardly a statement be make just the opposite in fact and the languid actor stare at each other without much on their mind it a selfdefeating picture and yet in an altmanquirky way it wear defeat proudly    from       n  what seem at first just another introverted french flick offer no more than baleful sentiment become for me on second view a genuinely insightful and quite satisfying presentation spoiler of sort follows poor cedric he apparently didnt know what hit him poor audience we be at first catch up in what seem a really beautiful and romantic story only to be lead back and forth into the dark reality of mismatch these two guy just didnt belong together from their first ambiguous encounter as much a mathieu and cedric be sexually attract to each other the absence of a deep emotional tie make it impossible for mathieu an intellectual be to find fulfillment in share life with someone whose sensibility be more attuned to carnival festivity and romp on the beach on a purely technical note i love the camera action in this film subtitle be totally unnecessary even though my french be presque rien i could watch it again without the annoy english translation and enjoy it even more this be a polished very professionally make motion picture though many scene seem superfluous i rate it nine out of ten  n  i dont think ive ever give something a rating but this one easily get the denomination i find it hard just to sit through one of his joke it not just that the joke be so bad but combine that with the fact that carson daily have zero charisma cant set up or finish a punchline and youve get a late night comedy recipe that will really turn your stomach i have watch the show never in it entirety but many time still it just creep up on me after conan i usually watch a minute or two just to see if carson daily be still the bad talk show host ever actually if you ever do see him interview a guest it just that an interview i feel so sorry every time he have a guest on and their confused smile try to mask their body language thats scream get me the hell away from this freak i do recommend watch the show not for a laugh but to ponder how he get on the air and what he still do there watch as much a you can i think you will find it complete awkwardness     interesting  n  in the standard view this be a purely awful movie however it rate a near perfect score on the unintentional comedy scale i can think of few actual comedy that make me laugh as hard a i do watch this movie andy griffith ghost dress in native american garb dance sends me into hysteric everytime i wouldnt waste the gas or energy driving to the video store to rent it but if you happen to be lay on the couch at in the morning and it come on tv check it out  n  from the film first shot keira knightley a elizabeth bennet wander read through a field at dawn thus invoke all the clich  s cinema have develop to address the phenomenon of the strongminded rebellious female character in period drama i know i be in for something to make me want to kill myself joe wright seem not only to have not read the book but to be under the regrettable misapprehension that what he be film be not in fact jane austens subtle nuanced comedy of manner conduct through sparkle delicate social interaction in eighteenth century english drawingrooms but a sort of ucertificate wuthering height thus we be treat to every scene between elizabeth and darcy take place outside for no apparent reason in inappropriately rugged scenery and often in the pouring rain not to mention that jane austen and in particular p p be not about passion sexual tension or love it about different strategy of negotiate the stultification of eighteenth century society which be completely ignore so that the bennet house be a rambunctious chaotic place where everybody shout at once run around leaf their underwear on chair and pig wander happily through the house the society ball become rowdy country dance one step away from a matrix reload style danceorgy and everybody say exactly what they think without the slight regard for propriety the genius of jane austen lie in explore the void create by a society in which nobody say what they think or mean because of an overwhelming regard for propriety and the tragic predicament of her character arise from misunderstanding and miscommunications enable by that speechless gap so both the illiance of jane austen and the very factor that allow her plot particularly in this film to function be completely erased subtlety in general be nowhere int his film sacrifice in favour of an overwrought drama which jar entirely with the material and the performances it be so obviously try to be a  serious  film the humour which be pride prejudice both austen methodology and her appeal be almost entirely suppress in favour of all this pofaced melodrama and when it be allow in be handle so clumsily pride prejudice be a serious narrative which make serious point yes but those serious point and weighty theme be not just intertwine with the humour they be embed in it you cant lose jane austen technique leave only the bare bone of the story and expect the theme to remain not even when you replace her technique with your own heavyhanded mysticalnuminous fauxow cinematography elizabeth bennett be suppose to be a woman an adult mature and sensible and clearsighted keira knightley play the first half of the film like an emptyheaded giggling schoolgirl and the second half like an emptyheaded schoolgirl who think she be a tragic heroine elizabeth wit her combative verbal exchange her quintessential characteristic of be able to see and laugh at everybodys folly include her own her strength and composure and her fantastic clearsightedness be completely lose and replace with     what a lot of giggle and star into the distance rather than be able to keep her head when all about her be lose theirs she start to cry and scream at the slight provocation and not genuinely rag either no these be petulant hissy fit and where the great strength of austen elizabeth at least in austens eye be her ability to retain integrity and observance while remain within the boundary of society and sustain impeachable propriety knightleys elizabeth have no regard whatsoever for convention furthermore she seem to think that wander around barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth century version of overall establish her beyond doubt a spirited and strongminded and therefore nothing in the character a write or the performance have to sustain it an astonishingly unsubtle and bland performance in which quest for blandness and weakness she be ably match by matthew macfayden donald sutherland a mr bennet seem weak ineffectual and permanently befuddle without the wicked sense of humour and ironic detachment at the expense of human relationship that make mr bennet so fascinating and tragic his special bond with lizzie a the only two sensible people in a world of fool be completely lose not least because both of them be fool in a world of fool and that completely deprive the end of the film of emotional impact mr bingley be no longer amiable and wellmeaning to the point of folly but be play a a complete retard for cheap laugh and the woman who be play jane be so wildly inconsistent that she may as well not have try to do anything with the character at all the script veer wildly between verbatim chunk of jane austen deliver with remarkable clumsiness and totally contemporaneous language which would not be out of place in a modern day romantic comedy just get the bbc adaptation on dvd and save yourself the heartache  n  ive always enjoy film that depict life a it be life sometimes have boring patch no real plot and not necessarily a happy end a river run through it be the perfect name for this film and norman macleans novel life ebb and flow like a river and it have it rough spot but it be a wonderful trip robert redford ings a lot to the film his narration have a friendly feel that fit the picture perfectly a a director he be restrain and calm and capture some incredibly beautiful scene a for the act craig sheffer and brad pitt work surprise well a others i dont know quite how to describe tom skerritt and brenda blethyns performance except that they truly feel real a river run through it be a wonderful film   out of  n  the story be very trustworthy and powerful the technical side of the movie be quite fine   even the directing of it the main problem be with the casting that turn that movie into almost another local and regular clich   with a great lack of impact and even great lack of impression beside the small role of the father rafael play impressively by asi dayan all other actor be unfortunately not in their best the role of the elder blind girl play by taly sharon be fresh but without any intensity a the lead role therefore the figure she act have become mild and low profile there be moment and episode that look more like a rehearsal then a real movie but after all it a good point to begin from and to make big improvement in the future  n  this movie be not so much promote here in greeceeven though it get good actor great script and rather good photograph be not a so called blockbuster movie in my country the movie itself be very powerfulits about the hard time that a newcomer have to go through when he return in his homevillage after be release from a yo prison time drug the end be rather sad     mourikis be try to keep up with his part and he handle it pretty well     lamopoulou be great and very sexy in a strange way and of course hatzisavvas be for one more time close to excellency     out of because very few greek movie can make such an impression  n  mystery men have get to be the stupid film ive ever see but what a film i think it be fabulous excellent and impressive it be funny welldone and nice to see ridiculous super hero for a change and be able to pull it off this be great ill definitely watch it again  n  you know that mouthwash commercial where the guy have a mouth full of listerine or whatever it be and he try really hard to keep from spit it up into the sink thats a great metaphor for this movie i keep watch even though it be really difficult but keep mouthwash in your mouth will leave you with a minty fresh feeling this movie leave me with a bad taste in my mouth i should have spit it out when i have the chance the premise be corny enough to be fun for the first time in like a thousand year gargoyle have return to romania and all of the priest who know how to fight and kill these thing be long dead it up to michael pare and some other secret agent to get to the bottom of thing before the gargoyle run amok unfortunately the premise be completely lose in bad dialog and less than enthusiastic act on the part of the human lead the best acting be do by the cg gargoyles in the end this movie feel like a poor man van helsing if you check your ain at the door this might get you through a dreary monday night i give it out of star  n  i cant believe it that be the bad movie i have ever see in my life i laugh a couple of time probably because of how stupid it be if someone pay me to see that movie again i wouldnt the plot be so horrible it make no sense and the acting be so bad that i couldnt even tell if they be try that movie be terrible rating f  n  this be one of a rarity of movie where

absolutely favourite band i never have the chance to hear their music a it be release but have love them since i can remember its the sort of film that be worth try the once i can see why it wasnt release in the cinema but it be certainly a great film to put on the tv i be flick through my tv guide and happen to see this film it didnt much detail except something like john lennon and paul mccartney meet after the beatles have oken up jared harris star id never hear of him he play john or aiden quinn who play paul however they be certainly underestimated actor the film have a slow start but a it develop i could see how well quinn but especially harris play their character a a huge fan i sort of know what the real lennon and mccartney be like the script be illiant and harris get lennon accent personality and mannerism spot on quinn play mccartney quite well but sometimes go into his irish accent the makeup artist make them look excellent this paragraph may be count a a  spoiler  a i mention before it get off to a slow start but soon develop and become quite an emotional film i find the bit in the park a total waste of time and quite out of character for both of the musician a for lennon rude line in the italian restaurant totally unnecessary the end be very poignant and ings a tear to my eye whenever i watch it it be quite different from the other biographical film ive see where it about how the beatles get together and become famous and those never really do the character that well e g backbeat in conclusion i would say if youre a beatles or john lennon or paul mccartney fan give it a chance you may have pleasent surprise at only about minute long it worth wait for the film to develop if anyone do know whether the meeting of really do happen please send it to the comment page for this film id be very interested  n  an american werewolf in london have some funny part but this one isnt so good the computer werewolf be just awful the perspective be all off it like see them through a distorting mirror the writer step on the throat of many of their gag american boy say to parisian girl be there a cafe around here instead of just leave it at that they have to have the girl sigh and respond this be paris  n  originally i be a tenacious d fan of their first album and naturally listen to a few track off the p o d and be rather disappointed after watch the movie my view be change the movie be pretty funny from begin to the end and find my self engage in it even though it be really be a stupid storyline because of the attitude that kg and jaybles portray in the movie much more entertaining and enjoyable than movie i have see in the theater lately ex saw iii dull and drag casino royale way to homoerotic which in prior installment i have really enjoy if you enjoy borat you will enjoy the tale of the great band on earth  n  this be just one more of those hideous film that you find on lifetime tv which portray the abhorrent behavior of some disgust woman in an empathetic manner along with other such nasty film a the burning bed enough or monster this film take a disgusting criminal and attempt to show the viewer why shes not such a bad person after all give u a eak heres my question to the filmmaker if letourneau be a man and vili be a year old girl would you have make a picture sympathizing and empathize with this person answer hell no imagine switch the gender in this film and then youll see just why myself and others here consider this a worthless piece of garbage be the gender switch there would be no attempt to empathize with the criminal instead wed likely be treat to a portrayal of a monstrous and hideous man prey upon a young girl his lascivious behavior land him in prison and his ainwashed victim suffer from stockholm syndrome the only reason letourneau do not receive the same treatment in this film be by virtue of her sex lets call a spade a spade letourneau be a pedophile plain and simple no ifs ands or buts shes a criminal who belong in prison and deserve our derision and contempt but certainly not our pity or empathy  n  the premise of this movie be decent enough but with sub par act it be just bland and dull spoilers the film do not work because of the nature of the death it be accidental so although it be a murder it wasnt like the guy set out to do it also through some flashback there be a secret that be reveal that sort of make the event like justice to a degree there be no emotion in this film the first minute or so be just this woman call her sister and hear her message it be dull and boring with some polishing and good act it could have be pretty good  n  the life of the saint start off with an atmospheric vision of london a a bustle city of busy quaint street and sunshine i be hop it would maintain this atmosphere but it get bogged down in a story that go pretty much nowhere othello work for big fat mr  karva his crimeboss stepdad at least i think that be what he be suppose to be because it never really defined but he do drop kitten into deep fat frier so trust me hes a prick do scrappy little errand while his skanky girlfriend give daddy handjobs one of his colleague be runner a black dude who be always dash from a to b  until the day he come across almost mute homeless child who grant him his wish of be able to stop run runner dump the lost boy in othello flat where he promptly start grant more wish keen to have some of his own desire fulfil karva have the boy kidnap but he isnt sure of what would really ing him happiness be it the innocence of be a child again or be it another handjob either way i dont want to see the little boy grant him the second it just take age to get go and there be load of repetitive scene the end try to be shock but since there hardly any backstory on investment in any of these character it only serve a a release for the bored audience writer tony grisoni a favourite of terry gilliam try to blend in some kind of religious allegory which end up be pretentious a all hell ironically if he give u something more accessible or at least have good explanation for the character suddenly act all weird then it would have be a more enjoyable film a it be we be introduce to a bunch of annoy loudmouth who then miraculously seem to develop intelligence when confront by the mysterious boy who origin be never reveal thats just plain irritate aside from sporadic moment of atmosphere and a moody score this film have little to recommend  n  i cant emphasize it enough do  not  get this movie for the kids for that matter youd best spare the adult from it a well all right perhaps im overexaggerating a little this isnt the bad kid movie     no let me rephrase that this isnt the bad movie make by dissilusioned adult for dissilusioned adult and somehow marketed towards kid that would be jack which ive be mean to review gut like a fish  adults wont learn anything surprising well if you must fastforward to just before the end credit for a educational bit about an interesting cosmic phenominon we dont usually end up do a adult what we want to do as kid a reality tend to get in the way well duh i could have tell you that so can four year of college at an art school but i degress  i have no idea what the heck kid could possibly get out of this movie most likely it will only upset them we get to watch the moment when rus be traumatize at eight year old theres a good movie kikis delivery service that have essentially the same message but handle it litely instead of drill it into your head and the adult will like it too by the way there be a moment in the movie make with amature mstkers in mind if they think of that other bruce willis movie with a sad little kid in it  n  be nothing else on tv be you really bore well then watch phat beach however dont rent it and definitely do not buy it that would be a big mistake i watch this on tv and find myself laugh at certain point i do not laugh long and i do not laugh hard however there be subtle joke and comment i laugh at if you be look for an extremely funny hood movie then watch friday if you be look for a powerful emotional movie something that this movie try at  kind of watch something like hoop dream or jason lyric if you be lookin for some good black booty go watch a dominique simone porn flick because the nudity in this movie be nearly nonexistent however if you have nothing well to do and this be on cable go ahead and watch it you will be slightly amuse     out of      n  the elegant documentary dont watch this movie     if youre an egotistical knowall student of physic this much less than one percent miniscule fraction of the population may find that this show just tell them what they have already learn and

physic include relativity quantum string and mtheory what a illiantly architected documentary start with some helpful historical background you will be lead step by elegant step into a universe of pure magic and dimension beyond i have always have a huge appreciation of mathematics this movie can easily give you an insight into what an exquisitely beautiful language mathematics be without make you feel like youre about to fail the grade the show be repetitive at time a the original format be a miniseries split over three show it therefore make sense to give u polite little reminder of the principle be present i find this immensely helpful a it keep remind me of the multitude of question and possible answer that make up this amazing tapestry of our very existence we be all and everything around u be viationalenergy with a natural tendency towards harmony this movie may blow your mind or at least help you realize that the universe be far far big than that which we see around u even with the hubble telescope and far far small than the proton and neutron within the atom we learn about in highschool mtheory hold many magnificent magnitude of possibility it just seem so appropriate that all of this elegance should by it very nature move by admission by the many illiant scientist present out of the realm of science and into the realm of philisophy you do not have to be religious at all to feel like this movie ought you one step closer to god bravo brian greene well do indeed p s if youre interested in feel even more comfortable and at home in your place in the

see before and ain cell be cell in the body that actually dont divide but if you can get over these little hurdle and put down the thing you dont like and hang on to those that you do there be a lot

produce a featurelength movie originally slat for directtovideo but bump up to theatrical status it would become know a batman mask of the phantasm ten year after phantasm we have have an additional three featurefilms release from the boy at the wb subzero return of the joker and now mystery of the batwoman join the family the plot be basic and in many way similar to mask of the phantasm a new female vigilante model herself after batman have begin target operation run by gotham mob bos rupert thorne and oswald cobblepot aka the penguin now batman must attempt to unravel the mystery of the batwoman before she cross the line the animation be the sleeker futuristic style that be utilize for batman the animated series fifth and sixth season aka the new batman adventure it quite nicely do and just as sleek a return of the joker animation there be also some use of cgi but it minor compare to the overabundance of it in subzero the music be alright different and exotic and similar to the justice league score although the point in the score when the old animated batman theme come up will be sure to send wave of nostalgia through the old fan rodentshaped hearts kevin conroy a always do a wonderful job a bruce wayne and batman it also great to have the old batman the animated series alumnus back that include bob hastings commissioner gordon robert costanzo detective bullock tara strong barbara gordon batgirl her cameo hint at the romanticrelationship between her and bruce that be mention in batman beyond and efrem zimbalist jr  alfred  villains be also great especially give that rupert thorne the old mob bos from the original series appear for the first time since the fourth season overall while not quite reach the standard set by mask of the phantasm ten year ago motb carry on the torch quite nicely for the animated batman film and if you have the dvd and be a hardcore fan you will love the fiveminute short chase me  n  i think this movie be suppose to be shock but the only way in which it be indeed shock be how shocking badly it be make     and simply be it oneandahalf hour of torment even more so for the viewer than for the character in the movie the five girl  sure the main character get their bloody piece in a bad way which be basically fine since it a horrormovie and i usually like horrormovies ive no problem with violence in these type of movie per se however all the violence in this film serve no end whatsoever it no spectacle other than that it simply grotesque it so lame it even get boring and really quick too the bad thing if the above wasnt bad enough for ya about this movie be that theyve try to copy the blair whitch project by film with cheap handheldcameras but again this too serve no end whatsoever in the blair which sure enough theres an explanation namely they be their with a camera look for the blair witch in this film theres no other explanation than hey yall we want this to look like the blair whitch the sound in the movie be also something to get depressed about the girl be scream so hysterically that many a time you cant make out what theyre say also no effort have be make to make anything any good soundwise or other wise than finally theres the soundtrack which be just as bad a the rest and varies from cheap eurohouse to the bad grungy hardrock     my advise dont watch this under any circumstance  n  why cant a movie be rat a zero or even a negative number some movie such a plan nine from out space be so bad theyre fun to watch this be not one the dungeon of horror might be the bad movie ive ever see some of anyway i have to fast forward through a lot of it fortunately for the indiscretion of my youth and senility of my advance age there may be bad movie ive see but thankfully i cant remember them the set appear to be make with cardboard and finish with can of spray paint the special effect look like a fifth grader c  diorama set in a shoebox the movie contain unforgivable gaff such a when the marquis shoot and kill his servant he then immediately get into a scuffle with his escape victim who take his flintlock and shoot him with it without the gun have be reload this movie be so bad my dvd copy only have name credit i guess no company or studio want to be incriminate though i guess when you film in your garage and make set out of cardboard box a studio isnt need this movie definitely rank in my cellar of all time bad movie with such horrible sacrilege a the manipulator the bad movie i have ever see with an actual one time hollywood lead manmickey rooney the only time i would recommend watch the dungeon of harrow or the manipulator for that matter would be if someone be to pay you im kind of cheap id have to have or buck for dungeon and at least ten for manipulator philthe never out of the can cinematographer  n  this movie take me by surprise the opening credit sequence feature nicely do animation after that be plunge into a semicheesy production betray it low budget the character typical american teen be introduce slowly with more personal detail than be usually find in movie like this by the time the shlitz hit the fan we know each one of the character and either like or hate them accord to their distinct personality it a slow uphill setup kind of like the ride up a slope of a really tall roller coaster thankfully once the action kick in it full blow old school horror steve johnson makeup effect be awesome equal in quality to much big budget film and the scare be jolt kevin tenney deliver his best movie ever with heartstopping surprise and creepy suspenseful setups the tongueincheek sometimes cheesy humor mark this film a pure s horror a oppose to the sullen tone of early genre fare like night of the living dead or hill have eye but for true horror fan this one be worth check out play it a the first entry on a double bill with the remake of house on the haunt hill the setup and character dynamic be so similar that you really have to wonder what film they be actually remake  n  though id heard that cama de gato be the bad brazilian movie of the decade i watch it give it a chance after all firsttime director producer writer alexandre stockler manage to make his debut feature shot in video for just u and though it look even cheap i cant begin to imagine all he go through to finally get it exhibit in theater with no big sponsor or production company behind it then a i watch it i realize why but whatever chance youre ready to give to cama de gato they shrink to zero within minute it an unbelievably preposterous verbose ideologically fanatical and technically catastrophic attempt to portray brazilian uppermiddle class youth a a bunch of spoiled neonazis hook on bad sex drug and violence and theyre make to look like closeted gay too make with no visible trace of talent imagination expertise or notion of structure visually and aurally it recall the bad amateur stuff you can find on youtube only here it last ninety two countem minute of unrelenting hysteria and clumsiness and it not even funnybad weve all see the story before bored young guy want to have fun go party take drug and everything go wrong there gangrape spank murder the accidental death fall down the staircase of the mother of one of the boy culminate with the boy decide to burn the corps of the girl and the mother in a garbage landfill moral and literal garbage get it the film be heavily influence by larry clark especially kid and bully but clarks film though also moralist and sexploitative be highclass masterworks compare to this crap i dont think there be ever such monomaniacal drive in a filmmaker to stick his idea down the audience throat stockler grab u by the collar and try to force his nonstop moralist rant into our ains by repetition and exhaustion you do get numbminded with so much babbling yell inept direction shaky camera and terrible act go on stockler doesnt care a bit about technique the quality of the image frame sound record soundtrack song dialog set edit etc be uniformly appal but hes a narcissistic controlfreak he anticipate the criticisms he bind to get by add subtitle with smartie cutie comment and by make the protagonist comment at one point how farfetched and phony it all be i could relate to that despite his megalomaniac ambition stockler seem incapable of give u a minimum of visual or narrative structure he cant even decide if he want gritty realism handheld video camera etc or stylization repetition of scene use of alternate take etc damn he cant even decide where to put his camera theres use of subjective camera for the three lead the dialog feature some of the most stupefyingly banal verbosity ever the plot exist simply to justify the director profound hatred for his character and what they stand for all you see be a filmmaker be hateful preachy condemn moralize without the benefit of a minimum of talent or technique to go with it its very disappoint to find caio blat in this mess certainly one of the most promising young film actor in brazil with his sleepyeyed puppy dog look and emotional edge that often recall sal mineos blat can be highly effective under good direction a in carandiru lavoura arcaica proibido proibir here hes tell to go over the top and he have to play with some of the most embarrassingly underequipped actor in recent memory he also enter the risky realm of graphic sexploitation scene so goddawful they look rather like webcam porn  the film open and end with real interview with typical middleclass youth stockler want u to take those interview a proof of what hes try to preach in fiction but he blatantly despise and make fun of his interviewee select a highlight of abject racist sexist stupid statement which only show asshole exist everywhere stockler want to prove that brazilian middleclass youth be all present or future fascist because theyre middleclass and enjoy recreational drug be he say all neofascists be on drug or that drug potentialize fascist behavior i couldnt tell with it dogmatic selfrighteousness headacheinducing technique and mindbending boredom cama de gato be bad for a reason but above all it harmful in a very insidious manner it give detractor of brazilian cinema a powerful case of argument cama de gato be best unwatched unmentioned bury and forget  n  an unforgettable masterpiece from the creator of the secret of nimh and the land before time this be a very touching bittersweet cartoon i remember this very well from my childhood it be funny and sad and very beautiful well it start out a bit dark a dog who escape the pound and get kill by an old friend end up in heaven and come back but it become sweet when he befriend an orphan girl who can talk to animals some scene be a bit scary contrary to other cartoon like the dream sequence of charlie but everything else be okayand the song be fair a memorable role of burt reynolds and dom deluise i just love that guy ahehehe and judith barsi of jaw the revenge may god rest her soul poor girl she didnt deserve to die but she be in heaven now all good people go to heaven overall this be a very good animate movie a don bluth classic enough to put anime and disney to shame recommend for the whole family and know this if you have the original video of this youll find after the movie dom deluise have a very important and special message get ta love that guy ahehehe  n  this movie be a failure a a comedy and a film in general it be a very slow pace movie that seem to be try to convey a message but the message be a clich   hopeless mess to begin with this movie fall on shameless environmental point even make a selfrighteous point of destroy an suv and promote animal planet in sit through this i couldnt help but notice that steve carell get no more than a single truly funny line the only thing that could hypothetically mark this a a comedy be the pitiful attempt to give comic relief line to wanda sykes her character get frequent cringeworthy line where they absolutely do not fit far from the illiance of bruce almighty evan almighty blow it whole recordeaking budget on special effect plot device that turn out to barely advance the plot the movie spend the first half build up to the construction of evans ark but by the end we learn that the ark be completely meaningless and the whole plot be a just a vessel for the stupid gag and even stupid message the movie conclude when we learn that the whole ark flood and animal gathering be just a weak political statement by none other than god yes god be try to influence politics  n  it be so gratifying to see one great piece of art convert into another without distortion or contrivance i have no guess a to how such an extraordinary piece of literature could be recreate a a film worth see if you love bulgakovs book you would be understandably afraid of see some misguided interpretation do more for the sake of an artfilm project than for actually inging the story deeper meaning to the screen there be a couple example of this with the master and margarita a complex and farfetched a the story be the movie leave out nothing it be a if the filmmaker read bulgakovs work the same way an orchestral conductor read a scorewith not a note miss why cant we find such talent here in the u s  so now my favorite book and movie have the same title  n  this movie be very violent yet excite with original dialog and cool character it have one of the most moving story and be very true to life the movie start off with action star leo fong a a down and out cop who be approach the end of his career when he stumble on to a big case that involve corruption black mail and murder this be where the killing start from start finish fong delivers in this must see action caper this movie also costars richard roundtree i really enjoy this film a a child but a i get old i realize that this film be pretty cheesy and not very good i would not recommend this film and the action be very very bad  n  the day have finally come for me to witness the perpetuation of azumis fate a an assassin fruition of her character and the ultimate attempt to draw me deep into the world she rampage through so mercilessly during the first saga thats as poetical a ill get when talk about azumi death or love because when i cringe over the heavy sentimentality of house of fly dagger and complain about the credibility of aya ueto portray a blooddriven assassin after watch azumi i start to appreciate the previously mention shortcoming more than ever before not only do the determination of each assassin feel sluggish and uninspiring but also many important element be omit from the entire experience in azumi we saw the assassin use various stealth tactic which be their number one priority as well a logic to make easy work of their mark with swift execution and quick ability to escape but i wont hold that against this movie too much since the story be slightly tweak this time around and many more obstacle be plant in azumis way to prevent her from reach the warlord and display any sign of charisma by the way chiaki be foolishly shelve for the most part of the film and be basically play a tone down version of go go minus the cool weapon and sense of menace this ings me to the final blow which be the action simply disguise in the title a the death side of the epic in the first half of the film we see the debut of many promising adversary with flashy look and even flashy weapon to no one surprise they meet their end one way or another but the film fall short when each of them start die too fast and too easily in azumi the young assassin be mostly overpower the opposition with quick but somewhat satisfying battle and the final showdown between azumi and bijomaru in comparison to the fight in azumi be at least climaxed and worthwhile some interesting effect be introduce but they be unable to achieve innovation due to the shortness of each encounter i be in no way knock down the conventional style of samurai film with their quick and realistic battle but character in both azumi film be so imaginative and straight out of anime that the rule could have be oken and the action should have be further enriched the romance side of azumi be there to fill in time between the fight scene and unfortunately at the end it serve no purpose nor provide a much need resolution as a fan with an open mind for wide variety of movie and animation i wont lie and ill admit to my neutrality and unimpressiveness towards the first azumi film but ill step right up and say that after watch azumi the original be make to look like a flawless masterpiece for what it worth azumi death or love could have go straight to video with it invisibly richer budget and a failed potential to add or even expand on the bumpy journey of desperate assassin do their best to restore the peace with an unwavering courage to die try  n  this have to be the bad piece of garbage ive see in a while heath ledger be a heartthrob he look deformed i wish id know that he and naomi watt be an item in real life because i spent of the long hour of my life wonder what she saw in him orlando bloom be a heartthrob with the scraggly beard and deerintheheadlights look about him i cant say i agree rachel griffith be her usual fabulous self but geoffrey rush look a if he couldnt wait to get off the set im suppose to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderer this be a far cry from butch cassidy which actually be an entertaining film this be trite clicheridden and boring we only stay because we be convince it would get good it didnt the last minute or so be unintentionally hilarious heath and his gang be hole up in a frontier hotel and woman and child be die because of their presence thats not funny but it be funny when they walk out of the hotel with the armor on because all we could think of be the black knight from monty python and the holy grail i keep wait for them to say ill bite yer leg off we be howl with laughter a be several other warp member of the audience when we leave pretty much everyone be talk about what a waste of time this film was i may not have pay cash to see this disaster sneak preview but it certainly wasnt free it cost me hour of my life that i will never get back  n  a very ordinary madefortv product tyson attempt to be a serious biopic while stretch the moment of angst for effect fast forwarding through the esoterics of the corrupt sport of boxing and muddle the sensationalistic stuff which be the only thing which make tyson even remotely interest a lukewarm watch at best which more likely to appeal to the general public than to box fan  n  im sure deep in the recess of jack black mind the character of nacho lie be absolutely hilarious but no it isnt you can tell ol jack have a whale of a time hammin it up play a smarmy slimy mexican friar with dream of become a wrestler but this movie be a total misfire in just about every single department i just sit there through most of the movie thinking be this suppose to be funny and this be the guy from tenacious d right the truth be this film have nothing to offer at all it a lousy script with crappy character and really naff acting and direction youll watch endless moment where you think something funny be surely about to happen but it just doesnt i be bore stupid about minute in but though it would surely pick up it didnt minute later id barely manage to stave off an aneurism it be that painful its like remember year ago when youd see anything with your fave actor in it even some of their really early pap from before they be famous and youd be really embarrassed that say actor be actually in such a load of plop yeah it like that ive enjoy some of jack black earlier movie like shallow hall and im really look forward to see pick of destiny but come on man if you do this to u again jack im gon na have to come round there and hammer your kneecap or something at the least give you a serious talk to i know it a clich   but this be one of the bad movie ive ever see and for so many reason      n  i havent read the anne rice novel that this movie be base on but who know maybe read the book be cheap than rent queen of the damned and be probably well for your health it isnt that this movie be necessarily bad for your health but a book can be very relaxing and certainly exercise the active part of your ain more so than this movie you can count the number of page by anne rice that ive read on one hand but after see this movie and interview with a vampire i get the feeling that she write really good novel the plot for both movie hint at a whole sea of deep and interwoven vampire history still stuart townsends voiceover narration get a heck of a lot more annoy than brad pitts vampire narrative ever do and you can tell that queen of the damned limited production resource barely give enough flesh to the anne rice storyline while interview decide to go with lace and elegance queen relies on low budget special effect that try really hard to be take seriously one can see that the original novel have potential a a movie and that the production team focus it attention in the wrong place the costume and rock roll stage could have be replace with more blood and an eerier soundtrack however ill give credit where credit be due the soundtrack be excellent korn and disturbed have me down with the sickness bob my noggin like butthead the film open with a very cool gothrock zoom splice montage but after the first ten minute or so the directing degenerate quickly it a if the movie be so long that the director realize that there wasnt enough time and enough money to do an anne rice novel justice what result be some mediocre vampire scene and plenty of cheesy special effect unfortunately queen of the damn fails to do the genre justice just a it john carpenter counterpart fail to impress where be the yellow contact wheres the pale blue makeup scene after scene i shake my head reminisce about the day of salems lot and fright night when low budget be do right there be redeem quality though that save this movie from be garbage prop to aaliyah and may her soul forever rest in peace she might have become a renowned actress have her life not be take from u so prematurely for she do give this movie a decent performance with plenty of nice belly dance do i mention that the soundtrack be good let see what else can i say it wasnt too long the anne rice novel could have easily be a three hour movie if an ambitious director like francis ford coppola get his hand on it there be a few twist and turn here and there in the plot but all in all it be a legitimate rock and roll addition to the slew of secondrate vampire movie out there the director of this movie go on to direct a new battlestar galactica mini series if that tell you anything jyjimboduckdotcom  n  while i count myself a a fan of the babylon television series the original movie that introduce the series be a weak start although many of the element that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series be there the pace of the gathering be slow the makeup somewhat inadequate and the plot confuse bad the characterization in the premiere episode be poor although the rating chart show that many fan be willing to overlook these problem i remember the gathering almost turn me off off what soon grow into a spectacular series  n  leonard maltin give this film a dreaded bomb rating in his movie and video guide what film be he look at kid vengeance or god gun be bomb this film be a delight it be fantastic it be literate it be well mount it be beautiful photographed make a illiant use of color right from the opening scene the film grab your attention and tip you off that this film be a welldone satire of the whole spaghetti western genre the film be play for laugh from the beginning to the end with homage to douglas fairbanks sunset strip and the famous showdown in the good the bad and the ugly edd byrnes george hilton and gilbert roland work illiantly together to make the satire work it be too bad mr  maltin rat this film so poorly a it be undeserved one can only guess a to his reason i suspect that he miss the point of the movie entirely and be expect something more serious than this film be mean to be kudos belong to everyone involve in this project this film be a little gem wait to be discover by people who care about literate movie and appreciate satire  n  i dont believe there have ever be a more evil or wicked television program to air in the united state a the club they be todays equivalent to the ku klux klan of the th century their hatred of all that be good and sweet and human and pure be beyond all ability to understand their daily constant attack upon million and million of american as well a billion of human the world over who dont happen to share their bigoted cruel monstrous and utterly insane view of humanity be beyond anything television have ever see the lie they spout and the ridiculous lie they try to pass off a truth such a the idea of life after death or god or sin or the devil be so preposterous that they actually seem mentally ill so lose be they in their fantasy sane people know that religion be a drug and shouldnt let themselves get addict to that type of fantasy however the club be in a class by itself they be truly a cult while i believe in freedom of speech they way they spread hatred lie disinformation and such fantastic idea be beyond all limit i hope that one day the american psychiatric association will finally take up the study of those people who delude themselves in this way people who let themselves sink so deeply into the fantasy land of religion that they no longer have any real concept of reality at all treatment for such afflicted individual be sorely need in this country a so many people have completely lose their mind to the fantasy of religion the club though be even more horrible a it rise to the legal definition of cult but due to the club vast wealth con daily from the million of american lock in their deceitful grip they be above the law in this country for those of you who have see the movie the matrix you know that movie be a metaphor for religion on earth the evil one who be at the top of each of the religion who drain the one they have trap and cruelly abuse for their own selfish purpose and those million who be hold in a death sleep and slowly be drain of their life force represent those many people who belong to religion and who have lose all ability to perceive what be really go on around them in less civil time the good townsfolk would have run such monster a those associate with the club out of town with torch and pitchfork but in todays world where people have lose all choice in their choice of television that be present to them we have no way to rid ourselves of the club plague the television rating system and the v chip on tv should also have a rating call r for religion so that rational people and concerned parent could easily screen such vile intellectual and utal emotional rape such a present by the club every day all over our country from themselves and their child  n  if you wish to see shakespeare masterpiece in it entirety i suggest you find this bbc version indeed it be overlong at four and a half hour but jacobys performance a hamlet and patrick stewart a claudius be well worth the effort it never cease to amaze me how clear hamlet be when you see it in it length and order a set down by the bard every film version of hamlet have tinker with it structure olivier concentrate on hamlet indecision gibson on his passion jacoby be able to pull all of these aspect of hamlet character together with the aid of shakespeare full script why do hamlet not kill claudius immediately hamlet say i be very proud revengeful ambitious     hamlet be extremely upset not only for his father death and suspected murder or his mother marriage to his uncle but also and mostly because claudius have usurp the throne belonging to hamlet he be furious at his mother for marry claudius marriage between royal kin be not unknown do for political reason but that her marriage solidify claudius claim to the throne before he could return from wittenburg to claim it for himself he be therefore impotent to do anything about it and this be true even after he hear his father ghost cry vengeance he can not simply kill the king or he will lose the throne in do so he must out the king secret and here be the tragedy at the moment hamlet be successful in display claudius guilt in public he have opportunity to kill him and do not why he want it all he want revenge the throne and the damnation of claudius soul in hell hamlet overreach himself in classic tragic form his own hubris be his undo he kill polonius think it be claudius and the rest of the play spiral down to the final death of rosencrantz guildenstern ophelia laertes gertrude claudius and hamlet himself  n  the golden door be the story of a sicilian family journey from the old world italy to the new world america salvatore a middleaged man who hop for a more fruitful life persuade his family to leave their homeland behind in sicily take the arduous journey across the raging sea and inhabit a land whose river supposedly flow with milk in short they believe that by risk everything for the new world their dream of prosperity will be fulfil the imagery of the new world be optimistic clever and highly imaginative silver coin rain from heaven upon salvatore a he anticipate how prosperous hell be in the new world carrot and onion twice the size of human being be show be harvest to suggest wealth and health and river of milk be swim in and flow through the mind of those who anticipate what the new world will yield all of this imagery be surrealistically interweave with the character and help nicely compliment the gritty realism that the story unfold to the audience the contrast between this imagery versus the dark reality of the sicilian people help provide hope while theyre aboard the ship to the new world the voyage to the new world be shot almost in complete darkness especially when the seas tempest roar and nearly kill the people within the dark reality i refer to be the old world and the journey itself to the new world the old world be depict a somewhat destitute and primitive this be show a salvatore scramble together to sell what few possession he have leave donkey goat and rabbit in order to obtain the appropriate clothing he need to enter the new world i think it be rather interest that these people believe they have to conform to a certain dress code in order to be accept in the new world it be almost suggest that people have to fit a particular stereotype or mold in order to be recognize a morally fit the most powerful image in the film be when the ship be leave their homeland and set sail for the new world this shot show an overhead view of a crowd of people who slowly seem to separate from one another depict the separation between the old and new world this shot also suggest that the people be be tear away from all that be once familiar want to divorce from their previous dark living condition and be desirous to enter a world that hold more promise as later contrast to how the new world visually look the old world seem dark and bleak a compare to the ight yet foggy new world i think it be particularly interesting that the statue of liberty be never show through the fog at ellis island but be remain hidden i think this be an intentional directing choice that seem to negate the purpose of what the statue of liberty stand for give me your poor your tired your hungry seem like a joke in regard to what these people have to go through when arrive at the new world once they arrive in the america they have to go through rather humiliate test i e delouse mathematics puzzle etc in order to prove themselves a fit for the new world these test completely change the perspective of the sicilian people in particular salvatores mother have the most difficult time subject herself to the rule and law of the new world feel more violated than treat with respect where their dream once provide hope and optimism for what the new world would provide the reality of what the new world require be disparage and rude salvatore doesnt change much other than his attitude towards what he felt the new world would be like versus what the new world actually be seem disappointing to him this attitude be share by mostly everyone who voyage with him their character arc deal more with a cherished dream be greatly upset and a dark reality that have to be accepted the film seem to make a strong commentary on prepare oneself to enter a heavenly and civilized society cleanliness marriage and intelligence be prerequisites adhere to these rule be to prevent disease immoral behavior and stupidity from dominate perhaps this be a commentary on how america have learn from the failing of other nation and so be purposefully establish to secure that these plague do not infest and destruct though the rule seem rigid they be there to protect and help the people flourish  n  nifty little episode play mainly for laugh but with clever dollop of suspense somehow a martian have sneak aboard a okendown bus on it way to nowhere but which passenger be it talk about your illegal immigrant allstar support cast from wildeyed jack elam ham it up shamelessly to sexy jean willes if shes the martian then i say let open the border to cruelfaced john hoyt the most obvious suspect along with familiar face john archer and barney phillips and a nice turn from bill kendis a the bus driver make for a very entertaining halfhour even if the action be confine to a single set  n  i have before a feeling of mislike for all russian film but after see this film i haven  t this be a unique masterpiece make by the best director ever live in the ussr he know the art of film making and can use it very well if you find this movie buy or copy it  n  i watch mask in the s and it currently show on fox kid in the uk very late at night i remember think that it be kinda cool back in the day and have a couple of the toy too but watch it now bore me to tear i never realise before of how tedious and bland this cartoon show really be it just plain awful it be no where near in the same league a the transformer heman or thundercats and be very quickly forget by nearly everyone once it stop be make i only watch it on fox kid because ulysses come on straight after it thats if mask doesnt put me to sleep first one of the less s cartoon that i hope to completely forget about again once it finish air on fox kid  n  phantasm      class phantasm ii       awesome phantasm iii       erm       terrible even though i would love to stick up for this film i quite simply cant the movie seem to have sell out first bad sign come when the video have trailer for other film at the start something the others do not also too many pointless character prime examples the kid who be a crack shot funny initially but soon you want him dead the woman who use karate to fight off the ball erm not gon na work or rather shouldnt and the blooming zombies what the hell be they do there there no link to them in the other phatasms also there be a severe lack of midget run about the only good bit be the crack start and of course reggie b possible spoiler come up to me this film seem like a filler between ii and iv a extra character just leave at the end so can continue with main in iv overall very very disappointing  n  ludicrous angelic yearold annakin turn into whiny at yearold annakin who somehow seem appeal to amidala year his senior now yearold jedi warrior hero annakin have a couple of bad dream and so take to slaughter child his friend and the entire framework of his existence because a crazy old man convince him a his precious wife might really die and b only he can prevent this ludicrosity squared i think the people who like this movie be not pay attention the story be ridiculous the character be unbelievable literally not the perverted sense of fantastic wonderful etc  obiwan kenobi be the wise and kind anchor for the entire series but in the climax he hack off annakins legs let him burn in the lava and leave him to suffer doesnt anyone think thats a little out of character not to mention it be pretty stupid to take a chance on him live a it turn out i be expect at least a story that show consistent character with plausible motivation none of that here the story could have be write by a year old oh yeah the cgi be pretty cool  n  scotty grant cramer who would go on to star in the great bmovie killer klowns from out space agree to help three middleaged guy learn how to dialog the lady in this bad s comedy not bad a in s lingo which mean good bad a in bad with no likable character include but not limited to a kid whos the freaky look guy since friday the th part a girl who lead men on and then go into hissy fit when they want to touch her and the token fat slob because after all what would an s sex comedy be without a fat slob well this one have two this movie be pretty much the bottom of the barrel of s sex comedy and then come the sequel thus deepen say proverbial barrel my grade d eye candy too numerous to count you even see the freaky look kid imagine with boob at on point think bachlor party but not a funny and very disturbing where i saw it comcast moviepass  n  if you keep rigid historical perspective out of it this film be actually quite entertain it got action adventure and romance and one of the premiere cast matchup of the era with errol flynn and olivia de havilland in the lead role a evident on this board the picture doesnt pas muster with purist who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story tell to get beyond that one need only put aside the history book and enjoy the story a if it be a work of fiction i know i know thats hard to do when you consider custer last stand at the little big horn and it prominence in the history of post civil war america so i guess theres an unresolved quandary with the picture no matter how you look at it theres a lot to take in here though for the picture two hour plus run time custer arrival at west point be probably the first head scratcher rid up a he do in full military regalia the practical joke by sharp arthur kennedy put him up in the major headquarters probably should have get them both in trouble ironically a lot of scene in this military film play for comedy a in custer first meeting with libby bacon and subsequent encounter that include tea reader callie hattie mcdaniel i hadnt notice it before in other film but mcdaniel remind me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the forty mantan moreland so much so that in one scene it look like it might have be moreland ham it up in a dress with that in mind the owl scene be a hoot too as for flynn it interesting to note that a year earlier he portray j e b stuart opposite ronald reagans depiction of general custer in santa fe trail both vie for the attention of none other than olivia de havilland in that film reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of custer that history remembers while in flynns portrayal here it more than evident but it doesnt come close to that of richard mulligan take on the military hero in s little big man let just say that one be a bit over the top the good take away the picture have for me be the manner in which custer persevere to maintain his good name and not gamble it away on a risky business venture that and his loyalty to the men he lead in battle along with the discipline he develop over the course of the story most poignant be that final confrontation with arch rival sharp just before rid into the little big horn in which he declare that hell or glory be entirely dependent on one point of view earlier a similar remark might have give u the best insight of all into custer character when he state you take glory with you when it your time to go  n  the film quickly get to a major chase scene with ever increase destruction the first really bad thing be the guy hijack steven seagal would have be beat to pulp by seagals drive but that probably would have end the whole premise for the movie it seem like they decide to make all kind of change in the movie plot so just plan to enjoy the action and do not expect a coherent plot turn any sense of logic you may have it will reduce your chance of get a headache i do give me some hope that steven seagal be try to move back towards the type of character he portray in his more popular movie  n  interesting and short television movie describe some of the machination surround jay lenos replace carson a host of the tonight show film be currently very topical give the public drama surround conan obrien and jay leno the film do a good job of spark viewer interest in the event and show some of the concern of the stakeholder particularly of the nbc executive the portrayal of ovitz be particularly compelling and interesting i thought still many of the character be only very iefly limn or touch upon and some of the acting seem perfunctory nevertheless an interesting story  n  any film about wwii make during wwii by a british production company have no latterday peer in my opinion respectfully the confluence of so many thing near and dear to my heart be in at dawn we dive a a descendant of admiral horatio nelson and student of all aspect of world war two and particularly naval warfare i favor depiction of sub and action in the north atlantic and especially those which include the german side of thing for those unacquainted with target priority an attack on an enemy warship be the great event that a submarine can hope to encounter and such a rare opportunity would develop surprisingly similarly to what we see here the pacing be deliberate and typical of the work come out of the ealing rank and britishgaumont studio back in the day frankly i prefer it quieter more cereal approach for it humanity and realism that engage far good than any overproduced hollywood movie ever could this remind me of powell and pressburgers the th parallel thanks to the powerfully persuasive eric portman a favorite of mine john mill receive second billing and a small font in the title so this be clearly mean to be mr  portmans film but the whole cast shine a for the title sequence be i the only one who be utterly charm by gainsborough production lovely precgi gainsborough girl  n  a illiant horror film utterly gruesome and very scary too the thing be a remake from john carpenter but please do not let that put you off this film it be simply illiant the start of the film have the alien spacecraft hurtle towards the earth century before mankind walk the planet with an explosion that unleash the film title in amaze shin white and blue state the thing one of the best opening credit for a horror film ever the cast of actor who play the twelve man science team be a joy to behold and the location for the setting of their station in antartica be visually impressive on dvd widescreen it must have be great in the cinema i regret not see this on the big screen kurt russell be excellent a macready the helicopter pilot who reluctantly become the leader of the men try to combat a lethal shape change monstrosity that have infiltrate their base all the actor in this be really good and create terrific scene of paranoia and tension a to who the thing have infect my favourite scene in the whole film have to be when macready test everyone thats still alive for infection it be tense scary and finally spectacular i love it because it funny a well special mention must go to rob bottin for his truly amaze make up effect and shape change design of the alien itself if he didnt get an oscar for best visual effect at the time then he damn well should have this be also debatable a to whether this be john carpenter great film     it certainly a gruesome masterpiece wait for a cold winter night get some budweiser from the fridge sit down and watch the thing a horror masterpiece of flame throw hero fight shape change tower of gore and slime utterly illiant ten out of ten  n  i absolutely love this film everything about it it almost felt like watch me and my friend on screen the way this movie be film be a pure masterpiece very original and creative i relate to these character and even have the same thought a some im really glad i run across this movie if only there be more genius like justin out there  n  no one can say i wasnt warn a i have read the review both user external but like most of u attract to horror movie     curiosity get this cat come on we all scream at the people in the movie not to go into the dark room but you know thats horror aficionado be always die to know whats in there even if we know itll be bad  the bottom line be that this movie leave me angry not because it pretend to be real who care     gimmick be allow or because the actor and dialogue be so lame be this an unusual event in horror movie or even because the movie be so bad and i be be polite here what really get me mad be that the film be not only a rip off of bwp but also a halfhearted lazy rip off at that i dont believe in sacred cow and if they think they could outdo bwp then kudos to them but they didnt even try the movie be make with little effort or care and that be the most unforgivable sin in horror or any movie  n  a new way to enjoy goldsworthys work river and tide allows fan to see his work in motion watch goldsworthy build his piece one develop an appreciation for every stone leaf and thorn that he use goldsworthy describe how the flow of life the river and the tide inspires and affect his work although i be happy the film cover the majority of goldsworthys piece no snowball i do feel it be a bit long the film maker do a wonderful job of inging goldsworthys work to life and create a beautiful film that be a joy to watch  n  if you like william hickey in prizzis honor he resurrect his character a don anthony in mob bos this be a very weak godfather satire with few laugh stuart whitman look perplexed a to what hes do in this schlockfest morgan fairchilds performance be one of the good effort in the movie and that alone be not a good sign for sure eddie deezen vacillates between three stooge slapstick and a bad woody allen imitation fatally flaw mob bos be so derivative that boredom quickly overcome comedy and the film drag on with car chase hide weapon in a restaurant bathroom and numerous other nonsense merk  n  i have see most if not all of the laurel hardy classic film i have always enjoy there comical stupidly even after watch it over and over again this new film attempt to ing back the classic with two new actor who resemble both laurel hardy however fail miserably for various reason one of which be how out of place their cloth be still early th century however be both portray in the s set some of the former dialogue be ought back however it also fail miserably to come close to the classic series this film could very well be the bad film i have ever see and should be pull off the shelf and lock away forever the real laurel hardy be surly spin in their graf at such a bad imitation  n  i just start watch the show around july i find it by mistake i be channel surfing during a vacation it be a great show i just wish it wasnt on so late at night it on at be a a work person it make it hard to watch all the time i read some comment i do not agree with the late one about not grow up in the s and not believe that this stuff can happen i grow up in the s  im hispanic and i have a white boyfriend plus we have black friend in high school i believe people get along because of their interest and personality and it have nothing to do with be a certain race or color i cant wait till the show go on dvd so i can buy it this way i can see it from the beginning  n  this film be well cast often silly and always funny lemmon and matthau work their tag team magic to perfection brent spiner be just a riot a the egotistical tyrant of a cruise director from the first hare krishna to the last you ought pay him fifty buck for call you two stud i think this be a totally entertaining fun comedy  n  i have just give a for thief highway i mention this for two reason one to prove im not a git who only give bad review but because the theme of the film have the same thread namely the fall in love with a woman of the night we all know pretty woman be a chick flick but you cant avoid them all theyll eventually get you pretty woman for me do two thing two terrible horrible ghastly thing firstly it portray prostitution a a career more akin to that of a dancer you know with absolutely great friend leg warmer lot of giggle borrow each others make up you see in the reality of pretty woman the prostitute and this be a street walker prostitute be talk about here have a great life shes healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament my feeling be this happy hooker type protagonist be a lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character which for me beg the question if you make a movie about a type of person but be too chicken scar to adorn that player with the characteristic familiar to that role then why do it if i make a film about a chef but dont want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why make a film about a chef in the first place by bail out and turn the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story miss the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral or social question that it could have what a cop out really really lame secondly pretty woman insult romance itself edward lewis play by richard gere have no clue how to seduce or romance this lady that be without his plastic friend yep dont leave home without it especially if you be a moron in a suit who have no imagination out of of his romantic moment involve splash cash in one way or another even when he first meet her it the lotus esprit turbo that do all the work necklace here diamonds there limos over there money money money wheres the charm wheres the charisma dont mention that attempt at the piano please girls who like this film will also be girl who like shop more than most guy who like this film will not even have realize that old eddy have less charm than a calculator a they probably dont either so it wont have register more importantly anyone who like this film will hate thief highway a wonderful story of which part be base on the same subject ill finish on a song pretty woman hangin round the street pretty woman the kind i like to treat pretty woman i dont believe you youre not the truth no one could spend as much a you mercypretty woman wont you pardon me pretty woman i couldnt help but see pretty woman and you look lovely a can be do you lack imagination just like mepretty woman shop a while pretty woman talk a while pretty woman sell your smile to me pretty woman yeah yeah yeah pretty woman look my way pretty woman say youll stay with me  and ill pay you  ill treat you right  n  this movie be terrible the plot be terrible and unbelievable i can not recommend this movie where do this movie come from this movie be not funny and waste the talent of some great actor and actress include gary sinise kathy bat joey lauren adam and jennifer tilly  n  i strongly dislike this show i mean like basically everyone at that school be perfect and rich and i doubt a boarding school would look as cool a that and why do they suddenly allow girl into the school isnt that just a little weird anyways jamie lynn spear can not act she always have the same facial expression which really annoy me she be basically emotionless and all the guy seem to like her and shouldnt chase tell her he like her it not that hard really none of this show be real life and she isnt a girl like me because majority of the regular girl do not go to board school do not have designer clothes and do not live by the beach fake fake fake  n  normally i dont like series at all theyre all to predictable and they tend to become boring and dull very fast these series however be well played the story follow through all episode and even if you miss one the story will still be catch your mind the episode be all film on a hospital and take you further and far in to the mystery of dark and old secret that lie just beneath the surface of the mighty hospital  n  holy sh t this be god awful i sit in the theater for for an hour and ten minute and i think i be go to gouge out my eye much in the manor oedipus rex dear god this movie deserve no more credit than anything do by a middle school film buff please save your money this movie can offer you nothing unless you enjoy sideshow and sleep in movie theater you know hll ing your girlfriend and make thing interest you will be the only one there anyway f ck this slide show ye be warned i recommend not watch this hello how be you im pretty good enjoying this day i am this comment be onehundred time more fun than pretend to watch this daym movie this be sad  n  this movie be without a doubt a perfect     for all you people out there who be rating this film low grade because it have no good plot or anything like that thats ridiculous say that a jackie chan movie be bad because of it plot be like say a porn movie be bad because it have no plot you watch jackie chan for the fight scene for the action it not so much concentrate on a good story or anything like that if you look at how he make movie and compare it to other american film from that era and even later you will realize that jackie chans movie have over the top fight scene and not really good plot while american movie have good plot but shitty action scene compare to what jackie chan be do at the time porn be watch for the porn jackie chan be watch for the action i think you people be rating it bad because theres no plot because you think thats how a smart movie critic would rate a good movie but the way i see it be a good movie be a movie that can keep me entertained sure the middle of the movie be bore very boring but put it this way the rest which be all action scene and stunt very much do pay for all of that this do change the way how american action movie be create they have even stollen scene from this movie if you want a true man a true entertainer then watch this movie and many more of jackie chans he pure in everyway he literally make american movie look like a walk in the park and even in today movie american movie rely so much on special effect and safety wire and stunt double and so much more police story and many other jackie chan film be piece of work of a true entertainer who just go all out and be very talented in what he can do a masterpiece  n  i saw this at the london film festival last night apparently the short version james mcnallys summary of the content of the film be very good nossiter very deftly blend his investigation of the wine business into wider concern about globalisation homogenisation the effect of the mass medium the power of capital and the need for diversity the film be shoot on handheld dv which some might find offputting but which do enable nossiter to catch people off guard on a number of occasion which probably would not have be possible use more conventional equipment despite the sprawl feel of the film the editing be very sharp not only give u a parade of the world dog but also undercut a number of interviewee comment with somewhat contradictory visual image and give others sufficient rope to hang themselves to a degree this evoke michael moore recent work although nossiter operates in a more subtle way but probably the root of the film go back to marcel ophuls the sorrow and the pity both in the way the film be construct and in the emergence of salt of the earth french peasant a the star de montille pere et fils be present at the lff screening and answered question afterwards we do indeed all need a little disorder avo hubert overall an excellent film with implication that go way beyond the world of wine into the way we construct ourselves a people and organise our world  n  i cant believe this movie manage to get such a relatively high rating of it be barely watchable and unbelievably bore certainly one of the bad film i have see in a long long time in a nobudget way it remind me of star war episodes i and ii for the sheer impression that you be watch a total creative train wreck this film should be avoid at all cost it one of those festival film that only please the pseudointellectuals because they be so badly make those people think it make it different therefore good bad filmmaking be not different it just bad filmmaking  n  this movie really wake me up like it wake up the main male character of this avely different movie from his life slumber this guy john ben chaplin lead his mediocre safe life of a bank teller in a small provincial english town until the stunningly gorgeous wild girltodiefor nadia nicole kidman order by email from russia enters his life to become his beloved wife by john plan however a glitch turn up nadia do not speak a word of john language although calm and emotionless on the outside john becomes so interested in beautiful nadia that instead of use the full refund policy of the matching service he buy her a dictionary to start the communication process what happen henceforth in the plot really shakes poor john from his slumber of a decentlypaid safefeeling clerk into a decisionmaking decently think action figure give the viewer a subliminal message you would have probably act likewise kidman cassel kassovitz make a great team act russian and they be almost indistinguishable from the real thing almost only due to the slight accent present in their russian dialogue however slight enough to amaze a native russian by the hard work do to get the word sound right nicole kidman prove her talent once again by play a character quite different from the previous role at least from the cultural background the pace of the film be fast and captivate and you certainly be not ready to quit watch when the end title appear you rather feel that youre in the middle of the plot and be leave with a desire to see the sequel as soon a it come out my advice be to go out and get this film immediately and watch it and enjoy to sum it up it have an unusual plot great acting and idea below the surface like the idea of the rude awaken from the artificial safe routine life of a wheel in a societys machine the life which member of the fight club be so keen to quit and the machine of which pink floyd sings welcome to the machine i bet that in the end john be rather off with sophia on their way to the unknown than not have meet her at all thank you writer for the great story and everyone else for this great movie please make a sequel and you can stage it whereever and name the location whatever because the authenticity of the place be irrelevant to the percent of the potential viewer i be sure of it  n  ed wood ride again the fact that this movie be make should give any youngaspiring film maker hope any screenplay you might have think of use toline a litterbox or a birdcage should now not seem that bad do not watch this movie unless you have a healthy stash of tylenol or rolaids watch thismovie make me realize that boa vs  python be not that bad after all it probably would have be good to do this movie in claymation a at least that way no actor would have have to take credit for be in this film it be understandable why this director have so many alias there be a ight side to watch this movie in that if you can get someone to ing you a bag of chip then you can eat your way out of the cocoon of cheese that surround you enable you tomake your toward your tv set cocoon of cheese that surround it  n  this sport a nice deep cast but for a thriller you good deliver more than name actor and talk the first third of this movie be nothing but talk and more talk most of that be a bunch of woman bitch about everything to each other the first five list actor in here be woman so that verify that it really a chick flick and little else this probably play on the lifetime network there be a quick murder scene and then more talk by halfway through they have lose me by the way sally field look about year old in here  n  i think this movie have get it all it have really cool music that i can never get out of my head it have cool look character be really funny you know the kind that youll crack up on the ground and youll keep say the funny part over every day for three week  despite the bad act bad cgi and bad story about cop go after a robot it really cool it one of those movie you and all of your family can watch get together eat pizza laugh like crazy and watch it two more times there be so many funny part like when kurt be try to get edison attention and give him the finger and then throw a paint ball gun at him so they could play paint ball on that part i keep say remember remember to my cousin who saw it and show them what happen there be also a really funny part when edision run into the room and kurt be there just before they fight and kurt be talk about his strange dream and how he be superman i love that part although it have be a while since i saw it so i dont remember that part everything the actor say be funny like how kurt say i worship you like a god to the robot although there be some bad thing in all it be a great movie man i cant stop laughing i wish i have that movie  n  howard kevin kline teach english at the high school in a small indiana city he be finally get marry to emily joan cusack much to his parent delight the town be abuzz too because one of it own cameron matt dillon have be nominate for an acting oscar everyone include howard and emily be watch the academy award on television a cameron be declare the winner in his acceptance speech cameron announces that he be able to fulfill his role a a gay military man in part because of lesson he learn from a gay teacher he have in high school you guess it it howard but howard have never come out in fact he believe he be straight with the whole town and member of the medium wait and observe the happening will howard and emily go ahead and get married or be howard truly gay and realize he can not go through with the ceremony this be a wonderful funny and humane film about a gay man and his situation a the manwhodidnotrealizehewasgay kline be excellent and touch the rest of the cast be equally fine with cusack a stitch a the mixedup fianc   and dillon bob newhart debbie reynolds tom selleck and others on hand to delight the audience as well the costume be very nice and the setting in the lovely indiana heartland be beautiful then too the script the direction and the production be very very nice but the insightful humorous and the thoughtful look at the gay population be the film best asset no doubt for those who would be offend by a gaythemed film yes just skip over this one but for everyone who want to laugh heartily and gain a good understanding of the gay situation at the same time this be definitely the best film out there  n  when the opening shot be u s  marine seriously disrespect the u s  flag a movie have a tough road ahead but unfortunately it be downhill from there there be a military adviser credit who be also apparently a retired u s  marine make it even more baffling that this incredible each of protocol and law go unnoticed even more baffling be the way they simply gloss over how a marine be report kia then bury in very short order without the slight explanation of how they identify the body or if there even be a body the u s  government be still find the miss from wwii and it take month to identify the remains military shoot down remain mia for month or year and be only declared kia when the remains have be positively identify or after year of red tape here we be expect to believe that it happen within a matter of day or week maybe this happen in denmark but not in the u s  clearly none of the people involve ever have the slight involvement with or respect for the u s  military beyond that there be a number of other utterly laughable moment when character come up with zinger out of nowhere there must have be some really extended meeting between auteur and actor a they struggle to find their motivation for such hogwash have a script that work might have help but this one seem to have be make up on the spot work from cliff note theres no way to know if the script be this awful originally or if it be the auteur or the middlemanagement kid at the studio who bear responsibility either way this be an awful movie that should have never be make  n  we usually think of the british a the expert at render great adventure from the imperial age with the like of the four feather and zulu simply because the imperial age be for the most part british here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age americas projection of power under teddy roosevelt be the backdrop for this conventional tale of the kidnapped damsel who despite her gentility be smite by the rough manly nobility of her captor who in turn be disarm by her beauty and scorn politically correct prig eager to see some slight of native people or culture can rest assure that the way arab and muslim be depict here be far more flattering than the way their modern counterpart depict themselves on the current world stage what make this story different be the terrific production value faultless photography composition and edit the terrific cast the underappreciated brian keith play a bully teddy and vivid history though the wind and the lion be tell largely through the eye of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the character whether it be sean connerys noble igand candace bergens feisty heroine john huston wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelt big stick there be a transcendent scene at the end when the little boy be symbolically sweep away by the dash moor on his white steed this be high adventure at it best  n  i have be look forward to see dreamgirls for quite a while     what with all it raving review nomination and medium attention and i must say the first quarter of the movie be good it really portray the black music scene back then however a the movie wore on me and my whole family be bore out of our wit the singing just keep come one after the other i mean seriously just one more music number and it would have oke even with rent furthermore i notice hardly any character development in any of the character i just didnt care what happen to them even when eddie murphys character die of a drug overdose i know i should have be sad but i just couldnt feel any emotion for that character the character be give a flimsy background about sing in their childhood and whatnot but there personality be not reveal enough to draw me in finally the conflict be simply not significant enough to make the viewer care which go along with the lack of character development this movie remind me of a copycat movie base on ray chicago and rent ray and chicago be wonderful movie in my opinion overall i think this movie would best suit someone who doesnt really care about an overall story yet would enjoy two hour of entertain and fun singing performance  n  one of starewiczs long and strange short film follow a toy dog in search of an orange after become animate by the tear of the mother of a girl who long for an orange the dog come upon an orange after fall out of the back of a car on his way to be sell but at night must protect the orange when he come enter a devilish nightclub feature many bizarre and scary character with the help of a stuffed cat the dog get the orange back to the little girl and she be save from a terrible scurvy death the mascot feature new technique i have not yet see in starewiczs film the addition of sync sound and a mixture of live action with the stopmotion animation make for a new twist on starewiczs old style of puppetry live scene of move car and people foot walk by a a puppet sit on the concrete sidewalk be impressive and fresh the honking of car and cry of street vendor be noteworthy due to the fact that small studio shift to sound be costly and starewiczs utilization of the new technology seem like old hat new puppet character in this film be frighten contribution to the devil club scene twig and newspaper shred come to life skeleton of dead bird lay egg which hatch skeleton chick character come fly in from all over on pat and pan and rock horse a new editing technique use quick zoom which be accomplish through edit to speed up the pace of what before might have be a slow scene overall starewicz be able to update his style of filmmaking to meet the demand of a new audience making this film one of the best example of his work  n  nice character development in a pretty cool milieu be a male im probably not qualify to totally understand it but they do a nice job of establish the restrictive victorian environment from the start it isnt as bleak a it really be and the treatment of woman be probably even harsher what make this go be a wonderful chemistry among the principal character each have their own thing that they contend with once they come out of the rain and eak out of the spider web they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion what i enjoy about this movie be that it didnt go for cheap comedy when it could have it didnt try to pound a lesson into u the people who seem utterly without merit be really nicely developed human being who get to see the light i do have a little trouble with the alfred molina character have such an epiphany so quickly but within this world it need to happen good act all around with something positive take place in the life of some pretty good people  n  prussic gas a murderer don a red clansman suit and hood wield a white whip and the murder of college school girl at the hand of pay convict enlist by a mysterious mastermind who keep his face hidden within an office contain aquarium of turtle and fish the inspector at scotland yard higgins ijoachim fuchsberger and his superior sir john siegfried sch  renberg certainly have their hand full with this case it all seem to center around student ann portland uschi glas who when she turn be to inherit a great deal of wealth the girl who be target share a room with ann but the reason for their murder remain a mystery sys fine must figure out the staff of the girl dormitory all seem to be hide something and certain member of the faculty be fall prey to the killer in the red monk robe disguise talented enough to precisely strangle the neck of those attack with the whip two prisoner be commission by a mystery man to use the newly create toxic gas create by a scientist murder at the beginning of the film during what be suppose to be a monetary exchange for his creation it a clever scheme where a driver greaves g  nter meisner meet the convict   who hide in a barrel who be assist by a corrupt prison guard take blindfold to the secret room of the mastermind he give them order on who to kill and how uncovering this operation be a top priority for higgins and sir john for it will lead them to the truth they seek in regard to the murder and why they be happen under suspicion be girls dormitory headmistress her author other a sweaty incredibly nervous chemistry teacher a snooping gardener and the bannister some be red herring until they be dispose of throw the viewer for a loop each time until the real mastermind be discover the end feature multiple twist out of the krimi film ive see the college girl murder be the closest to a giallo with it colorful killer a convolute plot yield lot of surprise and potential suspect sordid shenanigan between adult and the college girl at the dormitory i think you can also see the influence of james bond on this particular krimi film with the villain mastermind secret hideout with an alligator pit   which isnt use the fake bible water pistol when open fire the gas into the face of startled victim the greave royles royce which have latch that cause flap to darken the window without reveal the passenger in the back seat and the peep hole use to spy on the girl in their room and while swim many might consider sir john a liability due to his bumble buffoonish behavior and how he often undermine higgins ability to get at the truth   perhaps poke fun at knowitall british inspector who harm a case more than solve it   i felt he be use a comedy relief particularly with his attempt at psychoanalyze suspect and potential victim often misunderstand what be tell to him higgins use the skill adopt over his year a an investigator instead follow the clues facts often avoid sir john as much a possible capable direction by the reliable alfred vohrer who keep the pace humming at a nice speed and the screenplay be full of interest character and lurid content  the fact that so many of the adult surround the dormitory be suspect any of them might be the one wield the whip or call the shot behind those murdered girl execution id say this may be one of the best   if not the best example of the krimi genre for it keep you guess always one more ace up it sleeve  the revelation unearth at the very end be quite eyeopening   and you even get a literal unmasking of the real mastermind pull the string to top it all off  n  i be very lucky to see this film a part of the melbourne international film festival only a few day ago i must admit that i be very partial to movie that focus on human relation and especially the one which concentrate on the tragic side of life i also love the majority of scandinavian cinematic offering there be often a particular deep quality in the way the story unfolds and the character be draw character building in this film be extraordinary in it detail and it depth this be despite the fact that we do encounter quite a number of character all with very particular personal situation and location within their community the audience at the end of the screening be very silent and pensive i be still play some of those scene in my mind and i be still amaze at their power and meaningfulness  n  this movie be really bad most of it look like it be film either in a park or a basement theres a giant spider but all we see of it be one leg there be some worm that live in a cave that be just cheap sock puppet with cardboard teeth and the plot be a bunch of postapocalyptic mumbo jumbo that make no sense at all the whole thing be just laughable  n  i think this be one hell of a movie               we can see steven fight around with his martial art stuff again and like in all segal movie theres a message in it without the message it would be one of many action fighting movie but the message be what make segal movie great and special  n  i saw this movie in the theater and be thoroughly impress by it then again that be when claire dane be a good actress not the foolish arrogant hollywoodized bitch she be today anyway this film really strike me a one of the more raw realistic beautiful friendship film how far would you really go for your best friend i be move to tear at the end and still tear up when i watch it now i own it i remember as soon a i leave the theater i call my best friend and sob to her how much i love her this be a great film to watch with your best girlfriend however be prepare for the almost certain conversation afterward where she turn to you and ask if youd do something like that for her      n  ive see this film literally over time     it absolutely jampack with entertainment power boothe give a stellar performance a a fan of actor such a william shatner impulse and ron liebmann up the academy i never think an actor could capture the intensity like shatner and liebmann in those role until i saw boothe a jim jones as far a im concerned power boothe be jim jones     this film capture his best performance  n  the three main character be all hopeless and yet you only feel sorry for one of them ernesto hopelessly devote to mercedes this be part of the frustration scream at mercedes to get a clue and ditch the nogood harry to no avail then theres the satisfaction steve buscemi have a great part a a transvestite and harvey keitels move story of his indignity play a gorilla for a cheap tv movie be incredible when you least expect it quentin tarintino be do half a monologue and anthony quinn turn ernesto into a wealthy man time and again great moment appear in the story but in the end it hard to know what to feel about this movie it doesnt have a happy end or even a complete one but it somehow feel right this movie be strange but then so be i no wonder i like it  n  reese witherspoon first out on the big screen be a memorable one she appear like a fresh scrubbed face tween slight and stringy but undeniably reese i have always like her a an actor and have no idea she start this young with her career go figure i actually gain some respect for reese to know who she be so early on i say that because whenever i have watch her perform the character thus far in each portrayal she also seem to have her own persona that live with that character quite nicely in fact anyway my first film experience with reese be the little red rid hood parody reese do with kiefer sutherland somehow i assume that be her first time up at bat not so well do reese  n  this game rank above all so far i have the honor of play mine on p so the graphic be really good the voice act be above standard the difficulty level be just right wesker have to be the best character in the re series in my opinion the story amaze me and take many different twist that i wasnt expect the only rating this game deserve be great  n  this movie be not worth anything i mean if you want to watch this kind of stuff flip to hollywood movie this totally be a disgrace to the bollywood name neal n nikki seriously suck never watch this movie a for the actor it appear the act gene skip a generation tanisha couldnt have wear less and uday chopra obviously be just pick because he be the director spoil son all of that halla re be amazingly stupid the song be eh and i hope the director do not spend to much money on it         bottom line i hat the movie do not let your kid watch it and if you have it in your house it be a stupid movie so discard it buy the cd if you must a i say the song be eh at least it be well then the movie  n  this be yet another western about a greedy cattle baron look to push out small rancher and farmer it certainly all be do before and since but the violent men be something special what make it special be barbara stanwyck play the role of vixen a she often do in her late film shes marry to the cripple edward g  robinson whos the cattle baron here but robinson be cripple and there be some hint that his injury may have leave him impotent no matter to barbara whose need be be meet by her otherinlaw brian keith that doesnt sit well with either dianne foster who be robinson and stanwycks daughter nor with lita milan who be keiths mexican girl friend the infidelity subplot almost take over the film but glenn ford a the stalwart small rancher who be a civil war veteran come west for his health manages to hold his own here hes every inch the quiet western hero who people make the mistake of push once too often i almost expect those famous word from wild bill elliott to come out of ford mouth im a peaceable man would have be very applicable in the vioilent men the fifty be the age of the adult western theme be enter into horse opera that hadnt be explore before the following year glenn ford would do another western jubal one of his best which also explore infidelity a a plot component theres enough traditional western stuff in the violent men and plenty for those who be addict to soap operas as well  n  apparently the mutilation man be about a guy who wander the land performing show of selfmutilation a a way of cop with his abusive childhood i use the word apparently because without listen to a director andy copps commentary which i didnt have available to me or read up on the film prior to watch viewer wont have a clue what it be about gorehounds and fan of extreme movie may be lure into watch the mutilation man with the promise of some harsh scene of splatter and unsettling reallife footage but unless theyre also fond of pretentious headacheinducing experimental arthouse cinema theyll find this one a real chore to sit through minute of ugly imagery accompany by dischordant sound terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue this mindnumbingly awful drivel be the perfect way to test one sanity if youve still get all your marble youll switch this rubbish off and watch something decent instead i watch the whole thing but be well aware that im completely bark  n  this movie be absolutely pathetic a pitiful screenplay and lack of any story just leave me watch three loser drool over bikini babe at time i felt like i be watch an episode of beavis and butthead i couldnt even sit through the whole movie emran hashmi disappoints and hrshitta bhatt be not impressive at all celina jaitley be not bad the only worthwhile part of the film be the spoof on anu malik and his obsession of shayaris it be pretty hilarious the song sini ne and it remix version be really good you can always count on emran liplocking and lipsynching a chartbuster all in all it seem emran doesnt have a good script from the bhatts to back him up this time  n  i feel the niiiiiight heat i feel your heeaaaaaaaaaartbeat something aint right theme song write by b j cook from skylark david foster old band and wife she also write the memorable theme from cbcs airwave oh night heat what a program wellwritten wellacted and totally classic crime solver and a good team and a dash of humour at the end id like to think this be really what detectives do did giambone be a real favourite on a canadian tip i learn every canadian actor name and style from guest spot do on night heat everyone pass through the night heat set and like law order it be storydriven so you could just watch and enjoy without a lot of character melodrama  n  this movie fail miserably on every level i have an idea let take everyone involve in this movie and ship them into a hot zone in the middle east maybe if be lucky theyll all be shoot and kill and we wont have to ever have our time waste by them again do i mention that i have never be so bitter about a cinematic pile of crap in my entire life my god i cant think of anything ive ever see that be this bad id rather watch ishtar time in a row than sit through minute of this sorry excuse for a film if i ever happen to meet anyone who be involve in this film ill spit in their face and then beat them senseless thats my two cent  n  yes ill say before i start comment this movie be incredibly underrated sharon stone be great in her role of catherine trammell a be morrissey a dr glass he be an analyst send in to evaluate her after the death of a sport star glass be draw into a seductive game that trammel use to manipulate his mind the acting be good apart from thewlis stone really have a talent with this role shes slick naughty and seductive and doesnt look a day old than she do in the first she really impress me like in casino morrisey be also good he show much vunerablitity in a role that need it thewlis however be lame he ruin his character and be overthetop the whole way he really sucked overall this movie not as good the first but stone be a hoot to watch just ignore thewlis  n  base on a edgar rice burroughs novel at the earth core provide little more than mean to escape and give your ain a rest a victorian scientist dr  abner perry peter cushing invents a giant burrowing machine which he and his american partner doug mcclure use to corkscrew their way deep into the earth to explore what mysteries it may hold they soon discover a lost world of subhuman creature have conflict with prehistoric monsters cushing come across a an absent mind professor to the point of be annoy instead of be a bold adventurer he come across effeminate on the other hand mcclure overact enough to make himself also laughable caroline munro play the pretty princess dia that refuse to leave her world near the center of the earth also in the cast be godfrey james cy grant and michael crane  n  i have see this film at least time and i be still excite by it the acting be perfect and the romance between joe and jean keep me on the edge of my seat plus i still think bryan brown be the top brilliant film  n  this show make absolutely no sense every week two lady go to an estate to do some gardening and every week without fail they somehow stumble upon a murder because everyone who own a big house with a large garden be involve in a murder right but even if they do somehow happen to stumble upon murder after murder wouldnt the smart thing to do be to tell the police you know the people who can actually do something about it     but every week these two fool go around pollute evidence commit crime of their own and in some case cause more murder once they do miraculously solve the murder there be no way the murderer could ever be convict all the evidence have be sabotage and youd think people who be cover up murder would think not to hire these two wouldnt you yay weve solve the murder now like every other week let go and confront the murderer ourselves and with no backup tell them that we know about it there be no way we could get ourselves into any danger be there rosemary and thyme be one of the bad show on television and certainly the most ridiculous  n  this movie be so bad it be funny for awhile there i think i be actually watch a parody of a bad movie a la for your consideration the cliffhanger scene at the end have me laugh until my inside hurt the script be dreadful enough but couple with sean young terrible act especially while she explain the entire plot in great detail complete with flashback while dangle off a cliff make it a truly classically bad movie worth watch in fact the fakey shot in this scene remind me of an ed wood movie i still cant believe how this thing get make first of all how do such a bad script get the green light how do star actor get attach be they at low point in their career question question  n  meryl streep be such a genius well at least a an actress i know shes be make fun of for do a lot of role with accent but she nail the accent every time her performance a lindy chamberlain be inspire mrs  chamberlain a portrayed here be not particularly likable nor all that smart but that just make streeps work all the more remarkable i think she be worth all or so of her oscar nomination about the film well there be a couple of interesting thing i dont know much about australia but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public play a big part in the story i have largely miss this when i first saw the film some year ago but it come through loud and clear yesterday and it seem the australian press be just as accomplish at miseryinducing pursuit and overkill a their american colleague a pretty good film a bit different grade b  n  airport be basically a slop together mess for universal studio to try and work a new twist the concorde supersonic airliner into their disasterinthesky formula bogged down with unintentional humor the best of which be when george kennedy stick his hand out of concordes window at supersonic speed to fire a flare gun at a heatseeking missile follow the aircrafts flight path and the simple fact that these dumb passenger keep reboarding the same plane to continue their flight despite all the problem in the air many star in this one include robert wagner sylvia kristel alain delon and martha raye a a nervous passenger not really relate to the other airport film  n  supposedly a social commentary on racism and prison condition in the rural south of the s nightmare be full of bad southern stereotype complete with phoney accent not only would it be offensive to the sensibility of most american southerner this tawdry piece of work come off as just a thinlydisguised babe in prison movieespecially in it uncut original version nevertheless act be generally above average and the late chuck connors in particular do a good job of make viewer hate himeven though he look somewhat uncomfortable in several scene there also a changeofpace role for the late robert reed who appear a the lecherous warden and tina louise previously ginger of gilligans island make a rather believable sadistic prison guard my grade d  n  ok i buy this film from woolworth for my friend for a joke present on his birthday because the front cover have a sexual innuendo in it but we decide it to watch it anyway just for hilarity purposes and im sorry but this have get to be one of the bad film in history it begin off alright and we think ok this might actually be ok  but after about minute we be sadly mistaken it begin when the mysterious paint baller turn out to be the most obvious character the scouser australian i say that because he have an accent which couldnt be identify whos act might i just say be abysmal then it get to the end and by that time we have all lose the will to live the paint ball finals the only thing i do like about this plot be that they didnt actually win but annoyingly enough they win by default and i know this have nothing to do with it but the name the team be give be just awful critical damage i mean they could of pick a more awesome name like the destroyer of the antichrist or something or thats what the film should of be call anyway  n  insignificant and lowained haha s horror like there be thirteen in a dozen yet it can be consider amuse if you watch it in the right state of mind the special effect be tacky the act atrocious and the screenplay seem to miss a couple of essential paragraph the brain take place in a typical quietamerican town set where every adolescent work in the same diner and where the coolkid in high school flush cherry bombs down the toilet it be here that a tvguru name dr  blake and his adorable petain begin their quest for nationwide mind control under the label of independent thinker a giant cheesy ain send out wave through television set and force innocent viewer to kill how cool be that now it up to the meadowvale teenrebel to save the world the funny thing about the plot be that it never explain where dr  blake and his monstrous ain actually come from there be obvious reference towards extraterrestrial life but thats about it meh who need a background in a movie like this really theres not that much bloodshed unfortunately and the evil ain look like an oversized sockpuppet the only more or less interesting element for horror buff be take a look at the cast and crew who make this movie director ed hunt and writer barry pearson be the same men who make bloody birthday guilty pleasure of mine and plague both those be much good movie and they wisely decide to resign the film industry the most familiar face in the cast unquestionably be the great david gale whom horror fan will worship forever for his role in reanimator a girl name christine kossak provide the nudityfactor and shes obviously a great talent   she have exactly movie on her repertoire of which this be her masterpiece in her debut she be credit a runaway model and in men and a baby her character be refer to a one of jack girl i really wonder how she feel about her career a an actress    n  do anyone remember the alternative comedy show the comic strip present one edition feature charles bronson robbie coltrane be interview about his new movie glc it about a man an ordinary man whose wife and family get wipe out by creep and i have to hunt them down and kill them in a sadistic and graphic manner and after glc what next for bronson be use a new angle my family dont get wipe out but i go after creep just the same this accurately describe the evil that men do it a bronson vigilante thriller where his motivation isnt down to a blood feud but this lead to credibility become strained bronson be a retired hitman who isnt give up his retirement for anything until someone show him a video tape feature interview with the victim of the doctor not the legendary time traveler but a infamous expert on torture it never really explain why the doctor be so infamous since any police state have a myriad of these sadist nor be it explain why the doctor and his sister have ridiculous english accent a you may guess it a lazily write movie and incident happen because the screenwriter need thing to happen to further the plot no matter how unlikely they be like one of the bad guy get invite to a threesome so he can be kill or thing be reveal like the doctor sister be a lesbian so some t a can be include in many way it like one of those nasty chuck norris vehicle that be be release at the same time but the most disappointing thing be that the director be also the same man who make ice cold in alex and the gun of naverone two very well regarded war drama that be often show on sunday afternoon believe me this movie wont be show until well after the watershed  n  well heres another terrific example of awkward s filmmaking the rudimentary premise of whats the matter with helen be quite shocking and disturb but it present in such a stylish and sophisticated fashion in the hand of any other movie crew this certainly would have become a nasty and gritty exploitation tale but with director curtis harrington whoever slew auntie roo and scriptwriter henry farrell hush  hush  sweet charlotte in charge it become a beautiful and almost enchanting mixture of theme and genres the basic plot of the film be definitely horrific but theres a lot more to experience like love story a swing s atmosphere and a whole lot of sing and tapdance the setting be unquestionably what make this movie so unique be literally catapult back to the s with a sublime depiction of that eras music religion theatrical business and wardrobe follow the long and exhaust trial that sentence their son to lifeimprisonment for murder adelle debbie reynolds and helen shelley winter flee to california and attempt to start a new life run a dance school for young talented girl particularly adelle adapts herself perfectly to the new environment a she fall in love with a local millionaire but poor old helen continue to sink in a downwards spiral of insanity and paranoia she only listen to the ramblings of a radioevangelist fear that she will be punish for the crime her son commit and slowly develops violent tendency the script although not entirely without flaw be well write and the film be adequately paced there never a dull moment in whats the matter with helen although the sing tapdancing and tango sequence be quite extended and much unrelated to the actual plot but the atmosphere be continuously ominous and the film definitely benefice from the terrific act performance of shelley winter shes downright scary a the unpredictable and introvert lady who about to snap any second and especially during the last ten minute or so she look more petrifying than all the freddy kruegers jason voorhees and michael myers combine there be several terrific supportive character who be sadly a little underdeveloped and rob from their potential like mich  al macliamm  ir a the cocky elocution teacher agnes moorehead a the creepy priestess and timothy carey a the obtrusive visitor to the lady house there be a couple of surprisingly gruesome scene and moment of genuine shock to enjoy for the grand guignol fanatic among u but particularly the set piece and costume design even nominate for an oscar be eathtaking  n  resnais wow the genius who ought u hiroshima mon amour take on the challenge of make a s french musical in viant colour the opening voiceover with old embellished intertitles be a nice touch then the camera aperture open like the old hand crankers on a black white placard the camera back off or rather up suddenly show u the surprisingly illiant colour of an elegant table set for a tea party this be all in the first seconds then the music start a rather banal and forgettable diddy feature an unconvincing chorus of girl blabber some nonsense which have no relevance to the film and yes i speak french so i cant blame it on the subtitle those character whiz out the door and be replace by more people who eak into an even more forgettable song then they leave and finally audrey tautou appear and we hear our first appreciable dialogue minute into the film im not sure what resnais intend by start off with such a yawn waste of time musical cacophony but the effect on the viewer be to make you want to hurl skittle at the screen and storm out i endured it didnt get much good ill tell you why there be absolutely no familiarity with any of the character we dont even see their face half the time a resnais seem too intent on show off the expensive scenery to care about the actual people in front of the camera people flit on off stage like moth around a lamp and we the audience be unable to focus on any particular person or plot it a if you be to take every episode of the brady bunch and cram it into a hour movie with bad songs the only thing that keep me watch as long a i do hour be that i be look at the camera techniques light and scenery which be all i admit excellent but be that enough to hold your attention for hour not me maybe tomorrow ill try watch the end aw who be i kidding i have more important thing to do im sure you do too skip this  n  i saw this movie in the middle of the night when i be flip through the channel and there be nothing else on to watch it one of those film where you stop to see what it be just for a moment but realize after twenty minute or so that you just cant turn it off no matter how bad it be one of those movie that be somewhere in between be so bad it good and so bad it well just plain bad it worth seeing just to experience the confusion of realize that it both great middleofthenight fare if only for the fabulous tennis drag dont even bother ask yourself why nobody can tell that chad lowe be so obviously male because logic do not apply  n  this movie take the plot behind the scifi flick doppelganger an astronaut from our earth crash on a counterearth on the opposite side of the sun and the cold war totalitarian vibe on that world and try to turn it into a pilot for a tv series however the whole thing sank without a trace and tv be probably well off for it everyone here be perfectly adequate in a make for tv way cameron mitchell turn in his usual solid performance so do glenn corbett who seem to be a kind of poor man john saxon who play the rugged individualist whose very existence pose a threat to the foundation of the world order on counter earth but the low budget and low energy and inconsistent script and the lack of any real imagination in the set design and cinematography keep this scifi adventure firmly tether on the launch pad ill give one example in the original template for this pilot doppleganger the astronaut lose control of their landing vehicle in a thunderstorm and crash their ship in a truly appalling sequence it be obvious that their ship be never go to fly again then the two astronaut stagger helplessly from the smoking remain of their vehicle in the middle of howl rain and wind only to be smack down and overcome by faceless men yell through loudspeakers in strand in space the astronaut be sit in their seat when buzzer sound thing start shake and the camera blur into a blackout and a a friend point out it be pretty obvious that the actor be simply shake themselves on their seat the director wasnt even shake the camera or the set ive see episode of the twilight zone and the outer limit that take more effort to establish mood and set than this madefortv mediocrity and that in essence be whats wrong with strand in space no budget no time no imagination     just make the token gesture and hop the scifi fan boys imagination and enthusiasm will fill in the rest sorry guy it didnt work im sure that everyone here just finish their work on this one and walk away and never think of it again except a a listing on their c v  and thats what you the viewer will do youll remember if press that you once watch a tv movie call strand in space but it make no lasting impression on you and you cant recall too much about it  n  black comedy isnt always an easy sell every now and then you get a black comedy that be hugely successful like fargo for example but usually they dont often find big audience people seem to either set their mind for comedy or for serious mayhem there doesnt seem to be a big market for a good mixture of both throw momma from the train be a fairly decent hit yet few people seem to remember much about it in this day and age danny devito just about hit this one all the way out of the park back in  devito play an odd mamma boy name owen look to rid himself of his outrageously overbear and unpleasant mother whom he still live with the mother be play by anne ramsey who pass away shortly after this be release and she be quite a caricature she be loud ugly rude and overbear though owen hardly seem like he could take care of himself he want desperately to have his mother off he fantasize about it in some truly weird scene but he clearly doesnt have the gut to actually do it himself thats where billy crystal come in crystal play larry donner owen creative write teacher at a nearby community college larry be a paranoid wouldbe intellectual novelist who claim his exwife steal his novel and make million off it he be currently try to write a new one but can not even come up with a decent first sentence the night be     owen hears larry wish his exwife be dead during an outburst at the school cafeteria and borrow the idea from stranger on a train owen decide to travel to hawaii and murder larrys exwife once it appear he have do so he expect larry to return the favor and kill his mother the result action be often quite funny and even poignant it certainly never dull and often full of surprises the acting be exceptional even if ramsey be a bit over the top crystal be as good a he can be and devito have always be undervalue a a performer the film relies on quite a bit of physical comedy which usually work often painfully so the film make use of some truly innovative edit technique in some scene and the offbeat tone be truly refresh i have often be critical of the late s a be a time of artistic malaise and down right lazy filmmaking throw momma from the train take chance both in how it character be draw as well a it general plot how many comedy revolve around a son have his mother murder the film isnt too long and it be chock full of laughs writer be apt to find it more interesting than the general public but it can still be enjoy by just about anyone of stars the hound  n  back in i have a really lengthy vacation around the fourth of july something like day off in a row what with two week pay vacation weekend and the holiday itself i stay in town during that time hang out at my parent house a lot i didnt have a tv in my apartment so i use to watch my parent tube i have just finish watch a segment of the x file when a program come on call personal fx i be hook instantly i have always be fascinate with item in our home that have come from my parent family home and through inheritance from relative estate and often wonder about their history value etc after my long vacation i use to go to my folk house on my lunchhours just to catch personal fx i can remember one episode during which cohost claire carter announce that the new york apartment in which the series be film be be renovate and that once say renovation be complete that personl fx would return to the air it never do personal fx be the first and best of the collectible show and it vanish from the air almost fifteen year later im still sore way to go fx  n  paul verhoevens predecessor to his eakout hit basic instinct be a stylish and shock neonoir thriller verhoeven have become know for make somewhat sleazy trash film both in his native holland and in america and this film be one of the reason why the fourth man follow the strange story of gerard reve play by jeroen krabb   a gay alcoholic and slightly mad writer who go to vlissingen to give a talk on the story he write while there he meet the seductive christine halsslag ren  e soutendijk who take him back to her house where he discover a handsome picture of one of her lover and proclaims that he will meet him even if it kill him paul verhoeven twist the truth many time in this film and that ensure that you never quite know where you be with it many of the occurrence in the fourth man could be what they appear to be but they could easily be interpret a something else entirely and this keep the audience on the edge of their seat for the duration and also make the film work a this narrative be what it thrive on paul verhoeven be not a filmmaker that feel he have to restrain himself and that be one of thing i like best about him this film feature a very shocking scene that make me feel ill for hour afterwards and that doesnt happen very often i wont spoil it because it need the surprise element to work     but youll see what i mean when you see the film make sure you get the uncut version there be also a number of other macae scene that be less shock than the one ive mention but be lovely nonetheless a man get eat by lion another one have a pipe send through his skull a boat be smash in half     lovely the acting in the fourth man isnt anything to write home about but it solid throughout jeroen krabb   hold the audience attention and look the part a the drunken writer it be ren  e soutendijk that impress the most though a the femme fatale at the centre of the tale her performance be what sharon stone would imitate nine year later with basic instinct but the original fatale do it best paul verhoevens direction be solid throughout a he direct our attention through numerous point of view all of which help to create the mystery of the story verhoeven have go on to make some rubbish but he obviously have talent and it a shame that he doesnt put it to well use of all the verhoeven film ive see this be the best and although it might be difficult to come across trust me it worth the effort  n  i accept that most s horror arent scary by todays standard but what the hell be this when you see a title like this you expect to see blood and a blood thirsty beast instead we get no blood at all and a beast who either want to take over the world or live in peace on earth      yeah which be what the people wanted the overall story be fine with the astronaut come back to life and be one with the beast      but the title really kill the movie night of the beast would have make the fan more happy because there really isnt any blood to speak of i like how the s movie have ending that leave room for a sequel but wisely never make one this movie isnt the bad ive ever see but it almost up there out of  n  demon wind be about as much fun a eaking your leg it be definitely an awful example of a film so awful in fact that i dont even consider it a movie i describe it more a a thing     a monstrous thing a thing that must be stop at all cost my friend and i first discover this     thing bury under a big box of video tape at my friend house it be a late night and we have nothing well to do so we decide to watch some cheesy horror movie we unfortunately pick this one well during the minute that this thing play we end up laugh so hard that we almost throw up the thing be literally pointless in every sense of the word it just a cheap poorly do ripoff of evil dead the whole story seem to be nothing more than some guy want to knock off his friend by invite them to an abandon house and let demon rip them to piece i have a bet that the writer be actually write the story while it be be film ive see bad horror movie before manos troll hobgoblin shudder i would have to say that demon wind could definitely contend with any and all of these film on term of sheer stupidity watch it only if you enjoy laugh at stupid films fun fact this film be like a cockroach on steroid much like the ouija board every time we try to get rid of it it always seem to mysteriously reappear kind of scary huh  n  there be a difference between a film and a movie a film regardless of quality be ready for public consumption a movie be what a group of friend get together to make over the course of a weekend with a camcorder in my time a a viewer i have see may example of both on september i attend a screening of writer director jon satejowskis donnyook now have read the script and have see two different cut a rough cut and the finished product of this piece i can safely say it be a movie and a student movie at that it be for lack of a good word competent which be to say the director know how to push record on a camera and capture move image the visuals be for the most part static and unimpressive and dialog scene be reduce to mostly long shot with little to no close up shot to allow the audience to establish a relationship with the character i understand that this be a modestly budget film but some visual flair would have be appreciate and it would have go a long way toward keep the audience interested granted there have be independent picture that have show that limited camera work can be over come with well a well write engross story and some sharp dialog steven soderberghs sex lie and videotape come immediately to mind this movie however have neither the main story be weak and unfocused if the main plot be davie try to mend his relationship with his father then i feel this movie miss the point what i get out of it be that davy main aspiration be to change the face of rock n roll however we see very little activity on his part to show this while there be one dream sequence at the beginning and an impromptu performance of his at the end all we seem to get be scene of davie listen to music or casually strum a guitar we be simply told that davie have play a lot of gig but we never see him in full rock out mode next time show dont tell the audience anyone who have take a creative writing class know this also davie doesnt look like someone that would have be big in the glam rock era of the s he look like hed be more comfortable in the early day of rock n roll posing a james deans less talented other in the meantime the rest of the movie event seem to happen at random to rather clich   character and story thread that have little or nothing to do with the slim main story be ought up and abandon with alarm frequency i e the subplot involve terry father if i want to see a film with this kind of haphazard construction i will consider watch napolean dynamite again a film i could barely make it through the first time as for the above mention dialog scene i guess i should mention that they be few and extremely far between be it too much to ask for character who do speak i dont think it be when the character do speak it be in short choppy sentence collection of oh so insightful question anger grunt or wildly overthetop outburst these character simply do not behave like normal rational people work with material like this it be easy to understand why there be only one good performance in the film al hudson and thats just because he do a poor imitation of sam elliott for his time on screen a good director or at least one who be ready for the challenge of a feature director would have be able to spot these problem and get the writer and camera people to correct them however with satejowski be so close to the material he simply doesnt see them or if he do he be unwilling to take the necessary step to fix them because itll hurt his creative vision be unable or unwilling to deal with criticism in a constructive manner be the mark of a selfindulgent misguided fool just ask rob schneider in the end we be leave with a poor highschoolset knockoff of zach braffs amaze garden state combine with the equally amazing velvet goldmine two film far more worthy of your time now before any of the cast or crew come out of the word work to take me to task for this review allow me to offer this the best i can do be compliment mr  satejowski for have the ambition to make a film of his own and to put it out there for an audience to see however the hope that this movie will be pick up and distribute be simply deluded vision of grandeur this be a student movie nothing more nothing le if the movie hold any promise and let face it at this point it isnt go to come from the act writing or direct it be this if if the people associate with this film be willing then please learn from this movie file it away and use the lesson learn on your next attempt dont attack your critic or have friend or family do it for you if you be able to do this maybe the next one will be worthy of distribution worthy of be call a film i be your audience and i be willing to watch  n  please rewatch all series and do not go see this movie the trailer be completely misleading and the weak character in the series stretch a badly think out min tv episode into the most painful hr of my life truly an awful film tubbs and edward be in it for a few min micky have line and her lipp just reel out the same tired old pun also mr isss accent just change about time in the film ton of badly act extra and really a few laugh that they seem to recycle for hr i honestly feel this series have be completely ruin by this godawful piece of crap              batman and robin all be forgive  n  finally an iranian film that be not make by majidi kiarostami or the makhmalbafs this be a nondocumentary an entertaining black comedy with subversive young girl subtly kick the system in it as it all about football and it funny it really funny the director say the place be real the event be real and so be the character and the extra this be why i purposely choose not to use professional actor a their presence would have introduce a notion of falseness the nonactors will have you root for them straightaway unless a  your heart be make of stone b  you be blind excellently script the film challenge patriarchal authority with an almost absurd freshness it have win the jury grand prize berlin dear reader it nearperfect where where can i get hold of it  n  sometimes you just have to have patient when watch indie horror if you can just toetap your way through the slowpaced early scene sometimes a real gem will present itself     this unfortunately be not the case with satan whip written and direct by jason maran satan whip attempt to drag u along on a boring snorefest of a film with no real pay off at the end im guess that the black white and blue cinematography must have be for a reason however it be never explain why the majority of the blood be blue and i find this increasingly annoy a the film go on the story in itself be not that bad and actually have some originality and decent content but the acting be simply pathetic this combine with the slowpacing and lack of any real red gore make satan whip one to forget quite quickly i will give it a rating for some witty dialog that make me chuckle but ala that could not save this boring waste of my time  n  taint look at kibbutz lifethis film be less a cultural story about a boys life in a kibbutz but the deliberate demonization of kibbutz life in general in the first two minute of the movie the milk man in charge of the cow rap one of his calf and it all downhill from there in term of the character represent typical kibbutznikim besides the two main character a clinically depressed woman and her young son every one else in the kibbutz be a gross caricature of well  evil the story center on how the kibbutz like some sort of cult slowly drag the mother and son deeper into despair and what inevitably follow there be no happiness no joy no laughter in this kibbutz every character situation represent a different horrific human vice like misogyny hypocrisy violence cultism repression etc for example while the protagonist be a strikingly handsome european look year old boy    his older other be a typical kibbutz youth complete with his jewish physical appearance and utish personality he care more about screw foreign volunteer than the health of his die mother he treat these volunteer like trash after his little other pleads of him to visit his die mother whom he hasnt see in a long time due to his military service he order quote    linda go take shower and i cum in two minute there be one other good character in this movie    a european foreigner who play the mother boyfriend when the animal rapist try to hit the mother son the boyfriend defend him by eaking the rapist arm he be summarily kick out of the kibbutz then for violent behavior against one of the kibbutz member more hypocrisy the indescribably annoy french woman who play the school teacher preaches that sex can not happen before age or without love and give an account of the actual act thats suppose to be humorous for the audience but be really just stupid she of course be screw the head of the kibbutz in the field who then in turn screw the little boy mom when her mental health take a turn for the bad the film portray the kibbutz like some sort of cult child get yank out of their bed in the middle of the night and take to some ritual where they swear allegiance in the field overseen by the kibbutz elders the mother apparently cant escape the kibbutz although in reality anyone was is always free to come and go a they choose it a mystery how the boy father die but you can rest assure the kibbutz drive him to it and his surviving parent be another pair of heartless wretched character that weigh down on the mother and her son thats the gist of this movie one dimensional character over dramatization dry performance and an insidious message that keep try to hammer itself into the audience head    that kibbutz life be degrade miserable and even deadly for those who didnt fit in i feel sorry for the guy who make this film    obviously he have a bad experience grow up in a kibbutz but i feel a though he take a few kernel of truth regard kibbutz life and turn them into huge atomic stereotype bomb  n  when will i ever learn the ecstatic reviewer on npr make me think this turkey be another citizen kane please allow me to vent my spleen     i will admit the setting presumably new york city have never be so downright ugly and unappealing i be remind that the s be a bad decade for men fashion and automobile and all the smoking if the plan be to cheapen the character it succeeded for a film to work at least in my simple estimation there have to be at least one sympathetic character only ned beaty come close and i could not wait for him to finish off nicky if a stray shot have strike mikey well it may have elicit a shrug of indifference at the most i cant remember when i detest a film a strongly i suppose im a rube who doesnt dig art flick oh well  n  lose carnivale desperate housewife     the list go on and on

n  clifton webb be one of my favorite however mister scoutmaster be not one of his best his patented curmudgeon role seem force and even unpleasant rather than funny the film itself be overflow with mawkish sentimentality in addition the viewer be present with numerous hamhanded reference to religious faith and u s  patriotism that come off a overreverent rather than genuine clifton webb do his best with a poor script edmund gwenn play yet another jovial clergyman and be give nothing to do the child actor lead be play by a talentless child who display a flat affect throughout the entire film his sole claim to fame a a performer evidently be a bullfroglike low voice unusual for someone of his age however once youve heard it youve hear it and you dont need to hear it again unfortunately he be in the majority of the film scene i find this child so irritating that i fast forward whenever he show up since he have a lot of scene in this film this mean that i fast forward through a lot of the film there be and be so many talented child actor it a pity this film doesnt have any of them in it still clifton webb in the traditional oadimmed hat and short be a sight worth see  n  this be a mustsee documentary movie for anyone who fear that modern youth have lose it taste for reallife adventure and it sense of morality darius go west be an amazing rollercoaster of a story we live the

for any nation of the world when war finally do arrive it ravage continue not for another five year but until at which time everytown be completely destroyed add to the desolation and toll on humanity be the wander sickness a pestilence that continue for another four years things to come balance both a fatalistic and futuristic world view where science hold out a hope for a revive civilization the wing over the world concept play out a bit corny though it spokesman cabal raymond massey be unwavering in his mission and dedicate to his cause if he fail others will follow this message be continually reinforce throughout the film ought home convincingly in masseys end of movie speech man insatiable need to test the limit of knowledge and achievement require an all the universe or nothing mindset the film imagery of automation and machinery in the second half be reminiscent of the great silent film metropolis a everytown be rebuild and transform by the year the spectacle of the city rebirth strike a resonant chord a architecture of modern city of today suggest the movie eerily prophetic vision be come to fruition where the movie get it wrong by sixty seven year though be man first mission to the moon but in a hundred year timetable probably seem more legitimate than  things to come be one of those rarity in film a picture that make you think which side will you come down

bystander risk be sweep away by force beyond their control  n  fulci     do this man ings one of the gory and weird movie ever make answer yes cat in the brain also know a nightmare concert be fulcis last masterpiece yes it be no matter what some people will say about it there be few fact why this movie be one of the best fulcis movies fulci make a fun of himself and his movie with this one lead roll in this movie be no other then fulci himself who play     well horrorsplattergore director who think he be slowly go insane it fill with black humor which unlike in the most of the modern horror movie work here be fulci flick you need to know it gory how much well pretty much i always love gore in the movie and i never get enough of it but cat in the brain actually stop my thirst for gore and believe me it a hard to archive even the braindead didnt stop it citb be all about gore almost every scene revolve about fulci who after be hypnotize by  khmmm  evil psychiatrist be see all kind of horror for everything that happen to him or everything he see some of the scene involve him accidentally drop the whiskey and instead of that he see rotten corpse lie on the floor which start to spit some ooze from it wound forget the beyond or zombie this be the gory fulci movie now i like how fulci manage to apply all those comic part in the gorefest movie he be such a illiant director some funny moment and line happens from time to time like one where fulci say make gore movie be kind of a sickness end be very good consider that fulci and most of the italian horror master be know for make end with no sense or many plot hole if you be fun of the fulci make sure you check it out if you have a weak stomach avoid this and repeat it only a movie ps some of the gore scene within this movie chainsaw dismemberment full tongue tear out eyeball tear out maggot infested corps zombie decapitation face be putt in boil water stab in the shower to head throat slit many part of the body and organ be toast aside hammer smash face      n  what an incomprehensible mess of a movie something about a cop who extract bullet from himself after he get shot and keep them in a glass jar in his bathroom and from the size of the jar hes be shot about fifty time by now and a top secret tank guard by five or six incompetent soldier who for some reason drive it into mexico whether they be send there intentionally or just get really really lose be never make clear and youll never hear another screenplay feature the word butthorn either gary busey try out the mel gibson role from lethal weapon and while busey be a serviceable actor the screenplay damn the whole movie to mediocrity william smith do another turn a a russian soldier the same character he play in red dawn a few year earlier after play biker heavy for most of the s it be sort of nice to see him expand his range play communist heavy sadly hell probably always be remember best a the guy who clint eastwood whupped in every which way you can  n  i love to watch this movie a lot because of all the scary scene about the raptor i like raptor because they be scary my favorite part be the one where the raptor look behind the pillar because it remind me of a scene from the friday the th movie with the girl who eat the banana i really love to watch a lot of this movie because the computer graphic seem a little fake but it okay because once you get into the movie you hardly even notice what be go on and i think it get a good end even though i didnt really understand what be go on on my first couple viewing i figure it out over time and thats the important part the other important part be how scary the dinosaur can be if youre watch it the first time this be best movie  n  warn review contains mild spoilersa couple of year back i manage to see the first five film in this franchise and be plan to do an overview of the whole elm st  series however just two year on and i find i cant remember enough about them in order to do it    i guess they couldnt have make much of an impression from what i do recall some of the sequel    dream warrior in particular    werent as bad a be often make out though even the original be no classic generally the predictability of the premise if people fall asleep they get murder in their dream doesnt lend itself to narrative tension but while i can not recall much of the first five film i do know they never plumb the depth of freddys dead an indication of how sick of freddy the public be at this point can be judge by the fact that the film be promote solely on the character demise the fact that the movie conclusion be not even hide but in fact the entire purpose for the film be go to illustrate how vacant soulless and cynical this venture was taking the morally questionable idea of have a child molester a the charismatic villain robert englunds innowayscary interpretation boom with laughter i always think freddys mockery of the teenage victim be less aim at the character than at the teenage audience that could ever watch this tripe it like englunds cry out we know this be garbage    but youre pay to see it so whos the one laughing and im sure victim of child abuse would be dishearten to see such an insensitive depiction of their plight be freddys appearance in the film always so rudimentary all he get to do here be a few haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr    har    har    hars and thats it if this be the only elm st  film youd ever see you wouldnt get to know the character at all even a the character predeath in a flashback englund play him a a boohiss pantomime villain with a slop of transatlantic ie overstate misplaced and not at all funny irony acting be almost universally poor just look at how many time breckin meyer overacts with his hand gesture and body language only kananga himself yaphet kotto keep his dignity and when roseanne tom arnold and alice cooper show up you can almost visibly see the film sink far into the mire the script too be absolutely lousy almost wholly without merit carlos ricky dean logan open a road map upon which the noel cowardlike freddy have wittily write youre f  ked when prompt for the map carlos respond well the map say be f  ked who write the screenplay oscar wilde or how about the scene where carlos be torture by freddy his hearing enhance to painful level so freddy torment him by threaten to drop a pin    a potentially fatal sound give that all sound be magnify oddly the fact that carlos shout at the top of his voice for him not to drop it seem to have no effect nice hear from you carlos quip freddy hop some good line will come along it also worth note that dream sleep doesnt occur instaneously so be knock unconscious wouldnt allow instant access into freddys world though a part of the narrative contain a human computer game and a d finale plot logic isnt that high on the list of requirements the teenager head the cast this time be really the most obnoxious dislikeable group in the whole series tracy lezlie deane be the only one who get to greet freddy with shut the f  k up man and a kick in the scallop and be incongruous pop music always part of the ingredient freddys dead no laugh no scar no interest no fun  n  some comment here on imdb have liken dog bite dog to the classic cat iii film of the s but although it be undoubtedly utal violent and very downbeat this film from pousoi cheang isnt really sleazy lurid or sensationalist enough to earn that comparison however it still pack a punch that make it worth a watch particularly if gritty hardedged action be your thing edison chen play pang a cambodian hitman who travel to hong kong to assassinate the wife of a judge sam lee be wai the ruthless cop who be determine to track him down whatever the cost with wai closing in on his target pang will stop at nothing to ensure his escape  until he meet yue a pretty illegal immigrant who need his help to escape her life of abuse a relentlessly harsh drama with great cinematography amaze sound design a haunting score and solid performance from chen and lee as well a newcomer pei pei a pang love interest dog bite dog be one for fan of hardhitting asian hyperviolence think along the line of chanwook park vengeance trilogy stabbings shooting merciless beating all happen regularly in this film and be catch unflinchingly by director cheang of course this be the kind of tale that be destine to have an unhappy end for all involve and sure enough pretty much everyone in this film die rather nasty death unfortunately there be a fine line between tragedy and unintentional comedy and in it final moment dog bite dog cross it in a laughably overdramatic final scene pang and wai be lock in battle a a pregnant yue look on eventually after all three have suffer severe stab wound during the fracas a wounded pang perform a diy ceasarean on a now dead yue deliver their baby moment before he himself dies whilst this film might not be a classic slice of hong kong excess with it deliriously ott action and stylish visuals it still worth seek out  n  i watch this movie for the hot guyand even he suck he be the bad onewell okay i have to give prop to that freaky police officer rapist guy too he be even bad the guy wasnt that cute in the end he have the most terrible accent and he be the most definite definition of hicksville idiot that cant stand up to his mom for the one he love there ever be overall and if this make any sense to you when i go to pick up movie at the video store i think to myself a i read the back of a movie that look so so well at least it cant be bad than carolina moon the most terrible movie and the most terrible write act ploteverything in it make my gag reflex want to do back flip it be the most horrid movie i will ever see with gaiela way up there too i hat it and trust me if there be any number under imdb have for rating id choose that in a heartbeat  n  absolute must see documentary for anyone interested in get to the bottom of this story tell with unflinching eye and with gripping style if you think conspiracy theory be for paranoid disturbed people this could change your mind something for you feds too a good model for government coverups if you like your news all tidy and easy to consume this be not for you  n  i have decide to not believe what famous movie critic say even though this movie do not get the best comment this movie make my day it get me think what a false world this is what do you do when your most loved one deceive you it say that no matter how often you fee milk to a snake it can never be loyal and will bite when give a chance same way some people be such that they be never grateful this movie be about how selfish people can be and how everyone be ultimately just think about oneself and work for oneself a other die inadvertently at the hand of a gangster the survive other decides to take revenge through this process we learn about the futility of this world nothing be real and no one be loyal to anyone amitabh give the performance of his life the new actor aryan give a good performance the actress who play the wife of amitabh steal the show her role be small but she portray her role so diligently that one be move by her performance chawla have really great face expression but her role be very limited and be not give a chance to fully express herself a great movie by raj kumar santoshi his movie always give some message to the audience his movie be like novel of nanak singh a punjabi novelist who novel always have a purpose and target a social evil because they have a real message for the audience they be entertain as well a lessongiving  n  after a very scary crude open which give you that creepy chainsaw massacrefeeling everything fall apart spoiler alert as soon a the two fbiofficers start jab you know they be the real killer anyone who have see enough of these fooledyamovies can figure this out this movie be mader with one thing in mind to depict utal murder why then be not the little girl torture and murder as well will this be next for u moviegoers the torture and abuse of child whats wrong with you people lynch be truly have a disgust ugly mind  n  i cant say much about this film i think it speak for itself as do the current rating on here i rent this about two year ago and i totally regretted it i even  tried  to like it by watch it twice but i just couldnt i can safely say that i have absolutely no desire to see this waste of time ever ever again and im not one to trash a movie but i truly believe this be awful it wasnt even funny in the slight the only bit i enjoy be the few scene with christopher walken in them i think this film ruin both jack black and ben stiller for me all i can think of when i see one of their film nowadays be this terrible movie and it remind me not to waste my money amy poehler be so very annoy too overall well i think you get my point the star be for walken by the way  n  i be not so old that i cant remember laugh at bobcat goldthwait a couple time but some where in all his year of drug abuse he lose his sense of humor as well a his ain cells from the moment this film open you can have no sympathy nor empathy for the female lead neither will you find anything remotely funny after hear the opening line goldthwait obviously hat himself so much that he need to degrade in order to feel well even if it be his own imaginary character he degrade if you ever saw shake the clown you know how unfunny bobcat be year ago     this movie be bad it be not even funny by accident it be sad pathetic and a total waste of time may goldthwaits hand be render paralyzed so he can not write another script strike his tongue so he can not dictate another unfunny scene he be sad and pathetic and need to make room for a new talent die to get into hollywood  n  in new orleans an illegal immigrant feel sick and leave a poker game while win the smalltime criminal blackie walter jack palance he be chase by blackie and his men raymond fitch zero mostel and poldi guy thomajan kill by blackie and his body be dump in the sea during the autopsy the family man lieutenant commander dr  clinton reed richard widmark of the u s  public health service find that the dead man have pneumonic plague cause by rat and he need to find who have any type of contact with the man within fortyeight hour to avoid an epidemic the city mayor assign the skeptical captain tom warren paul douglas to help dr  clint to find the killer that be infect with the plague and inoculate them panic in the street disclose a simple story but it be still effective and with a great villain the engaging plot have not become date after fiftyseven year jack palance performs a despicable scum in his debut and the camera work while he try to escape with zero mostel be still very impressive my vote be seven title brazil p  nico na ruas panic in the street  n  the box be why i originally pick up this movie and the back be why i rent it but i soon learn that i have be dupe i have think this movie would be something like a road trip eurotrip american pie deal but i be wrong this movie be one of the dumb ive see in a long time the unrated version tease you in to watch but will completely disappoint you the act be terrible and sound effect just gaudy it appear very low budget with the entire setting take place in the same building go out and get eurotrip or road trip instead i cant believe national lampoon put it name on this dont buy it dont rent it dont waste hour of your life on this  n  there have be many documentary that i have see in which it appear that the law be on the wrong side of the fence the thin blue line and paradise lose come to mind first and foremost but this be the first film that have me seethe with anger after i saw it it seem blatantly clear to me from the evidence present in this film that what happen at waco be at the very least an unprofessional and sloppy mess on the part of the fbi and afi and at the very bad an act of murder like most people when the siege at waco be occur i assume that david koresh be a completely evil madman who be lead a violent cult after see this i think that koresh be more likely a slightly unbalanced and confused guy who inadvertently catch the attention of the u s  government through his eccentric action sure there be lot of weapon at the branch davidian compound but none of it be illegal it be absolutely hearteaking to see the video footage of the people inside the compound all of them seem to be very nice and harmless and it be anger to see the callous testimony of the men in charge of the government force on the waco site the clueless testimony of janet reno and the partisan defense of the attack on waco a defense lead by a few of the committee democrats stand out most in my mind be ny representative and current u s  senator from ny charles schumer i vote for the man when i live in ny state im a democrat pretty leftleaning too after see his action on this committee i wish i could go back in time and vote for damato instead for anyone remotely interested in the government this be a very crucial film a must see i even think this should be show in class it that important  n  i saw this movie last night and think it be decent it have it moment i guess you would say some of the scene with the special ops force be cool and some of the location shot be very authentic i wont be put this movie in my dvd collection but it be fair enough to recommend for rent i guess nothing set the movie at another level compare to others of the same genre the action be good the acting be decent the woman be extremely seductive and exotic in my opinion and the story be pretty interest out of ten  n  yes i call this a perfect movie not one bore second a fantastic cast of mostly little known actress and actor a great array of character who be all well define and who all have understandable motif i could sympathize with perfect light crisp black and white photography a fitting soundtrack an intelligent and harmonious set design and a story that be engage and work it one of those prime quality picture on which all the pride of hollywood should rest the mark everyone should endeavor to reach barbara stanwyck be simply stun there be nothing this actress couldnt do and she always go easy on the melodramatic side no hysterical outburst with this lady i always think she be a good actress than screen goddess like bette davis or joan crawford and this movie confirm my opinion always as tough a nail and at the same time convey true sentiment it be fair to add that she also get many good part during her long career and this one be by far the least interesting the title fit this movie very well it be about desire human desire i think everyone can understand actually no one seem to be scheme in this movie all character act on impulse everybody want to be happy without hurt anybody else the sad fact that this more often than not lead to complication make for the dramatic content into which i will not go here i like what this movie have to say about youth about mature and about the necessity to compromise the movie i associate most with this one be alfred hitchcock shadow of a doubt it create a similar atmosphere of idealized and at the same time caricature small town america the story have a certain similarity with fritz langs considerably harsher movie clash by night make one year earlier where stanywck star in a similar part i can also recommend it  n  i would like to know if anyone know how i can get a copy of the movie thats the way of the world it be about year since ive see this movie and i would like to see it again earth wind fire transcend the nation globally with their inspirational music and theme it be unfortunate that this group didnt take off like their counterpart in the early s but a previously state racial tension exist in the united state which prohibit equalized exposure for the african american musical group it be good to see that earth wind fire continue their success i would like to add this movie to my collection someone please help me if possible thank you for your attention milton shaw  n  i saw the movie hoot and then i immediately decide to comment it the truth be that nature need protection from u because we be the dominant specie of this planet some people think that if they have money they can do whatever they want to which probably be like but if they think about the future more then they think about themselves they would do something useful this movie be not just about kid this movie be show u that the kid be usually the one that care more about it then the adult do when i be twelve i saw some waterlilies and i knew they be protect by law and didnt even dare to touch them not fear of the law but fear that i might harm them actually i be currently what so ever the acting be great the main character be well interpreted and we all have to learn from them i hope you all think about what you saw in that movie and enjoy  n  i have some reservation about this movie i figure it would be the usual bill of fare a formula movie about christmas be in the middle of a heat wave in late june we decide to give it a shot anyway maybe we would see some snow this movie turn out to be one laugh after another ben affleck be believable in his character but the real star of this one be james gandofini he deliver his line with a real wit about him and make a great dad if you want to have an enjoyable couple of hour definitely check this one out  n  when i first saw this film around month ago i consider it interest but little more but it stick with me that interest grow and grow and i wonder whether my initial boredom and response have more to do with the actual vhs quality rather than the film itself i purchase the criterion dvd box set and it turn out that i be right the second time alexander nevsky be a great film it be rouse and im sure it succeed in it main aim propaganda against the germans that be the most common criticism against this film and against eisenstein that it be merely propagandist and nothing else it untrue he be an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever live by now the world be far enough beyond joseph stalin to be able to watch eisenstein film a art  n  focus be another great movie star william h  macy i first discover macy in fargo and ive see a few of his film and he hasnt yet deceive me macy be the archetypal nice guy with something to hide in focus he play the role of lawrence newman a loyal and hardworking stiff who harbour his handicapped mother at home the scene be set after world war ii at the height of mccarthyism newman be the head of human resource for a company which be basically antisemite after he accidentally hire a woman of jewish descent he be ask to buy a pair of glass to improve his fail eyesight unbelievably the simple act of buy glass have great repercussion on his life and that of gertrude hart his wife play by a great laura dern a the film unravels newman will begin to see a whole different world where be jewish be akin to be an animal the movie be disturb in the way it show that be racist be something fairly normal the chilling thought be that in some place it probably still be  n  in brave new girl holly come from a small town in texas sings the yellow rise of texas at a local competition and get admit to a prestigious art college in philadelphia from there the movie grow into a colorful story of friendship and loyalty i love this movie it be full of great singing and acting and character that keep it move at a very nice pace the acting be of course wonderful virginia madsen and lindsey haun be outstanding as well a nick roth the camera work be really do well and i be very pleased with the end it seem a sequel could be in the make kudos to the director and all others that participate on this production quite a gem in the film archive  n  despite a totally misleading advertising campaign this flick turn out to be an irritatingly clich  d subpar haunt house flick with a totally implausible end clue for all consider see this turkey sam raimi didnt direct it although commercial for the movie play up his involvement in truth he be one of four producer it too bad that someone as talented a raimi have allow his name to be use in conjunction with such a poor movie i dont think he would ever have direct something like this that task be leave to the pang brothers the screenplay for this film seem to have be cobble together from numerous other horror film so youll find absolutely zero original content in the messenger what we get be a scene here and there that be pluck straight out of pulse a couple that could have come from the bird one or two from the others etc nearly every scene almost every line of dialogue be one that have be lift from any number of other movie the whole thing make for such a predictable movie that almost anyone will be able to figure out the surprise end long before it comes right about here would be a good time to point out that the advertising campaign center on the idea that only child can see ghost have nothing to do with this movie in fact everyone can see the ghost the teenage daughter and mother character certainly see them even quite early in the movie im sure that whomever be in charge of marketing come up with this campaign because the film need a unique angle to have any box office appeal which otherwise be entirely absent now you know so dont be fool perhaps what this movie lack most of all be anything resemble chemistry between the actor it simply isnt there all of the interaction come across a awkwardly stilted couple with the hackneyed story and ridiculous plot hole just what be a guy who murder his whole family do still lurk around the small town where the murder happen anyhow didnt anyone think to maybe arrest him it all add up to a profoundly unsatisfying ghost flick that only manage to surprise anyone over the age of ten with cheap shot loud noise visual flash and anything short of a sheeted figure jump out of a closet and yell boo all we get for our buck this time around be yet another poorlymade film about spirit attempt to warn people away from a house if there any message that the messenger deliver it dont waste your time on this movie  n  this movie suck ass something about a heatwave in some european country complete trash there nothing go for this movie whatsoever maybe second of sex but thats it there be a very annoying chick who hitch ride with people and really piss me off this movie be complete rash and you shouldnt subject yourself to watch it i regret it it very boring i would rate it zero but i cant no body in their right mind should see this im sure youll regret it completely i do how could they think up something this bad even mystery men be well mystery men that suck that movie wasnt worth be make complete waste of time the character in this be very hard to understand and i good very very very bored  n  i be look forward to the guardian but when i walk into the theater i wasnt really in the mood for it at that particular time it kind of like the olive garden i like it but i have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy it im not exactly sure what be dampen my spirit the trailer look good but the water theme be give me bad flashback to the last kevin costner movie that dealt with the subject waterworld plus despite the promise ashton kutcher show in the butterfly effect im still not completely sell on him something about the guy just annoys me probably have to do with his simian features it take approximately two minute for my fear to subside and for my hesitancy to slip away the movie immediately throw u into the midst of a tense rescue mission and i be grip tight than kenny rogers orange face lift my concern iefly istled at kutchers initial appearance due to the fact that too much effort be make to paint him a ridiculously cool and rebellious sunglass a tough guy toothpick in his mouth and sportin a smirk thatd make george clooney proud yeah we get it i be totally ready to hate him but then he have to go and deliver a fairly strong performance and force me to soften my jab darn you ape man efficiently mix tense excite rescue scene drama humor and solid act the guardian be easily a film that i dare say the majority of audience will enjoy you can quibble about it clich  s predictability and rare moment of overcooked sappiness but none of that take away from the entertainment value i have a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when costner start train the young guy but on the contrary the training session just might be the most interesting aspect of the film coast guard rescue swimmer be hero whose story have never really be portray on the big screen so i feel the inside look at what they go through and how tough it be to make it be very informative and a great way to introduce audience to this underappreciated group do you have what it take to be a rescue swimmer just think about it you get to go on dangerous mission in cold dark rough water and then you must fight disorientation exhaustion hypothermia and a lack of oxygen all while try to help strand panicked people who be depend on you for their survival and if all that isnt bad enough sometimes you cant save everybody so you have to make the tough decision of who life and who dies man who want all that responsibility not me i have no idea what it be really like for these guy and who would have think id have an ashton kutcher kevin costner movie to thank for the education not only do the guardian do a great job of pay tribute to this rare eed of hero but lucky for u it also do a good job of entertain it pay customers the gist moviegoer want an inside look at what it like to embark on a daring rescue mission in the middle of the ocean might want to give the guardian a chance i saw it for free but have i pay i wouldve felt i have get my money worth  n  go into see seven pound i wasnt clearly sure what to think because the preview leave to much open to grasp what the movie be really about so within the first min or so you be completely lose in the plot have no idea what be go on and you think tim who claim to be ben be just a big asshole all of this come to an end when the twistso to speak be unravel at the very last minute of the movie basically tim will smith be troubled and haunt by a big accident he make cause the end of seven people live by this he decide to scope out seven new people who be in need of help badly who he in turn give his life to the acting of this film be great a i feel will smith no matter what part he seem to impress rosario dawson to me this be one of her good movie aside from eagle eye which i think be up there to she have be in some bad some good but she do deliver in this film other actor such a woody harrelson have very small role and not a big enough role to grasp the character although the casting of the film be still good this movie be definitely not what i expect and certainly a lot slow pace in which i hop the movie however be still pretty good nothing be reveal until the last min of the movie and everything fall into place up until then it just seem like a pointless love story final think seven pounds seven star  n  i saw brother shadow at the tribeca film festival and love it judd hirsch and scott cohen be great a father and son the film follow scott cohen from parole in alaska back to his family in brooklyn he show up there because his other have die and he embark on a journey to slowly repair his estranged relationship with his others wife and child and his father who have never forgive him for be the black sheep of the family the story take u deep into the heart and mind of this family and allow you to more deeply understand the complexity of their life also the imagery of the woodworking business and the brooklyn backdrop set the tone for this rich and reveal family portrait  n  marar   xada really disappointed me i cant consider it a a bad movie but the development just seem too rush and nonbelievable for it to evoke any emotion dr  ferm   xadn display some unprecedented bizarre behaviour out of a passion that one cant really understand where it be bear from i mean how many time do he ever have a conversation with marar   xada maybe once also marar   xada never appear to be a real character instead more like a film stereotype that just need to be in the movie     or else another title be need some of the best acting come from a role that wasnt really important to the story that of marcial the subintelligent yet humble drunkard of course the scenery the cultural tidbit of the canary island and other wow moment be interest but the movie fell short of a documentary in case this be it real intention and most importantly a a solid drama  n  serum be about a crazy doctor that find a serum that be suppose to cure all disease through the power of the mind instead it create some kind of monster that need to eat human flesh and ains the mad doc create some zombie out of cadaver and have some problem there be a very long lead into all the action with many scene get you acquaint with the character the mad doctor nephew get into a car accident and the mad doc try to use his new serum on the boy the result be not good this be a class c film with ok act but some trouble direct and some continuity error there isnt much zombie action in this one and the effect while adequate be nothing special you can fast forward through the slow part and get some enjoyment out of the action scene watch out for some nudity and bad language  n  witty funny intelligent awesome i be flip channel late one night year ago come across this and a wildfire start i be stay up late every night and tap it for everyone i know a few like people out of the almost people i make watch this didnt think it be as awesome a i do the others be laugh out loud so hard they be cry and thank me at the same time please do yourself a favor run dont walk watch this and enjoy intelligence and humor it a winwin situation i wish i could have afternoon tea with him and meet the truly rare comedian that we a a society need more of      sanechaos  n  it a unique film a it give u our only chance to see the young noel coward in all his ironic glory because he seem so reserve detached he perfect for the role of an unloved cad who matteroffactly use all those around him however in the deadly serious no pun intend last act when coward must make like the fly dutchman he much less comfortable but his way with an epigram be peerless and hecht macarthur have give him some gem macarthur really he be the wit of the pair  the film be superbly light by the great lee garmes but have little camera movement aside from a storm sequence hecht and macarthutr care about one thing get their dialogue on screen note h m themselves have blinkandyoullmissem cameo a bum in the flophouse scene  the most notable support player be the one and only alexander woolcott notorious broadway columnist and close friend of both macarthur and coward who appear a one of the bitchy author always keep wait in the reception room of publisher coward curious that woolcott would agree to do a film that clearly lampoon the legendary algonquin round table of which he be a founder and macarthur something of an auxiliary member the scoundrel actually win an oscar for best story though that victory be probably due more to coward impose presence than any illiance in the plot it coward woolcott and the dialogue you remember      n  this be definitely a must see film the excellent director alain chabat also act a ceasar have manage to capture the very essence of the adventure of ast  rix the french comic book it base upon and to create a fantastically modern and intelligent comedy which be also an homage to the world of animated film this movie be so funny so full of joke both visual and speak that it might take you two or three screening before you notice them all between your burst of laughter the only drawback be that a nonfrench audience or at least a nonfrench speaking audience might not get all the private joke there be so many dialogue impossible to translate so many situation directly relate either to the comic book or to the french way of life that the fun might be lessen however it still totally worth see for the beautiful picture the amazing stunt the music the totally crazy atmosphere and the excellent act all actor be great but the film would not be the same without jamel debouze g  rard darmon and edouard baer and please dont ever compare this magnificent film to the terrible previous one base on the same comic book ast  rix et ob  lix contre c  sar and direct by claude zidi  n  i think this movie be stun with completely outstanding performance by valentina cervi artemisia gentileschi  cervi portray artemisia so beautifully with tentative yet confidant mannerism her hand map out an idea before move her model into place the passion to which artemisia give to her art be just spectacular to watch although not each character be overtly beautiful this make the film more realistic a the facial hair and clothing be perfect for that point in time overall i think this film be fantastic  n  i consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of box movie and a such there be only one thing that prevent me from call gentleman jim the best boxing movie ever make that be the robert wise paul newman flick somebody up there like me that movie might be number but gentleman jim be a close number  the movie doesnt just chronicle the rise of james j  corbett it also show the sport of box at a crucial time of transition in the late s boxing be move away from the utal day of bareknuckle rule to the more gentlemanly day of the gloved marquis of queensbury rule and the sport be move away from the day when it be an illegal spectacle and towards a time of acceptance and respectability gentleman jim be not a realistic look at those day it be romanticize and yes even a bit hokey at time but always delightfully so errol flynn be perfect a the gentleman jim who really isnt a gentleman at all but merely a fast talker from a work class family alexis smith be quite ravish a the upper class woman with whom he have a love hate relationship and we all know it be of course love that will win that match in the end  at the end of gentleman jim the great john l sullivan whose famous line be not i can lick any man in the world of course     romanticism again hand over his belt to corbett this be truly one of the best scene in any sport move ever make realistic no but wonderful hey if you want realism watch rag bull instead that be a much more realistic boxing movie but gentleman jim be a lot more fun  n  that this movie have be staple to the wall of a chapel a proof that god be truly dead be i the only one that really saw rather sleptwalked through this film this be the only movie ive ever see in the theater that i regret not walk out on and demand my money back it be just that dull and i even saw highland the quickening at the local cinema from begin to end gibson and downey have absolutely no chemistry a two unlikelies cast together by circumstance who eventually work together a best buddy the action what little there be be goofy and as dull a the skullbone of the writer thank whatever deity be chortle down at u a it observe our cinema that theres no chance for an air america  n  well theres no real plot to speak of it just an excuse to show some scene of extreme violence and gratuitous sex which can sometimes be fun too but it not in this case what else can i say about this     the action when happening be inventive and theres a cool scene where two character be fall from a skyscraper one that have to be several mile high but overall theres not much to recommend kite watch it if you want but youre not miss much if you skip this one      n  this be the best film the derek couple have ever make and if you think this be a recommendation then you havent see any of the others there be the usual ingredient it be just a poorly act a their other effort we can watch bo disrobe or audition for wet tshirt contest quite frequently the story be just laughably idiotic and the film take itself much too seriously and then orang utans in africa but it have a few thing go for it bo look great the production value set costume etc be quite good and this greatly enhance it camp value in a strange way it be actually quite funny simply because it try to be serious and fail so badly  n  some people drift through life move from one thing or one person to the next without bat an eye others latch on to a cause another person or a principle and remain adamant commit to whatever it be and figuratively or literally they give their word and stand by it but be all different make of different clay a one of the character in this film put it which be what make life so interesting some people be just plain crazy though and maybe thats the way you have to be to live among the mass who know who know what it take to make thing life work writer director lisa krueger take a shot at it use a light approach to examine that thin line between be commit and how one get commit and obsession in committed star heather graham a a young woman who be adamant committed obsessive and maybe just a little bit crazy too her name be joline and this be her story  n  hohum an inventor horst buchholz deadly biological weapon be in danger of fall into the wrong hand unknowingly his son luke perry have be work on the antedote all along enter cia agent olivia dabo and the catandmouse car chase and gunfire begin also in the cast be tom conti hendrick haese and an aging roger moore moore seem to haggardly move through this mess definitely not one of his good effort perry fan will be accept dabo be wrong for the role but nice to look at  n  note to self never ever ever again watch a serious movie with charlie sheen in it great comedian horrible seal this movie make navy seal look like a reckless group of ranger when in fact they be the most elite form of military in the world charlie sheen help destroy the navy seal reputation thank you for make such an incredibly select group of individual look awful in one of the bad action movie i have ever see this be a great story which could be make into an amazing action movie but why charlie sheen there be possibility for a very passionate story here but sheen decides to wreck them with funny comment  n  this movie be stupid there no get around it but so be dumb and dumber mind you dumb and dumber be significantly more funny than this however i for one love see stupid movie tail sting and laugh with a group of good friend over how bad it be call me callous but see this movie and youll find that the only way you can laugh at it be if you laugh at it instead of with it  n  i be look forward to this so much be a big fan of the book however when it come out i remember think it be one of the big waste of money and time ive ever spend at the cinema in principle the act the set and the music be excellent and be the main reason why im rating this a  in this version sara be a little too selfsacrificing for my taste there be no way she would have deliberately lie to miss minchin just to stop her punish the other girl in the book she make a point of describe lie a not just wicked but vulgar there also far too much of a disneyfied end for me saras father come back from the dead and all of them trot off into the indian sunset while the book do have a happy and critic might say equally improbable end it doesnt leave you think oh puhleeze about the only thing true to the book be saras father be a soldier the line between sara and her father be you learn me by heart  no i know you by heart you be inside my heart saras friendship with becky and her adopt lottie although this last one wasnt develop as much a it could have be the changing of her room by add various luxury item that part be illiantly do the basic core a rich girl be fling into poverty suddenly be there but thats about all that is people might say that this adaptation be more for the young audience possibly all i can say to that be i have two cousin age and respectively who be big fan of this film until they read the book if all you want be a feelgood family film then this delivers if youre look for a film that actually tell the story of a little princess in fact if youve read the book dont waste time with this one it such a shame with a cast like this if theyd stuck to at least the basic story it could have be fantastic am i harp on about read the book this and read the book that a little too much very probably but if someone attempt to adapt a book especially such a classic into a movie then they should at least have do the same thing preferably more than once  n  a always this be an inaccurate picture of the homeless tv tell a lot of lie about panhandler in the early s and make everyone look bad and claim we all make over a day when a day be much close to reality when someone drove by where i hold up a sign offering to work and offer me work i actually go and take the work if i be physically able and if i would be offer the id damn sure invest in in apt prepaid for at least year and keep most in the bank and still leave myself for nl and cash game at the casino i usually always win and could win decent if i just have a bankroll instead i win about a month be all playing in always minimum buying in due to not want to risk lose it all i be only homeless cause i didnt wan na risk spending all my money and go oke sometimes i have over in my sock while i sleep outside anyone want to talk contact sevencard on yahoo messenger i admit i be different than most homeless people though due to the fact i never drank smoke or take drug im no long homeless be now in govt housing for a month and get ssi and spend most of my time win at online poker mom and sunflower diversify worked hard to get me ssi glad my day of hide in under the stage in the convention center of the casino at night sleep worry about get catch by security be finally over have this tv crew pick me theyd be over a lot sooner it a shame how they dont good select who they pick  n  i really in enjoyed watch this movie like most of the people that watch it i wasnt sure that i be get whoopi goldberg be a very funny comedian and she have do a lot of funny movie i e sister act however this be not really comedy it be a drama with comedic moment so if your look for a laugh riot then keep looking this movie be about a black family move up from a nice neighborhood in the city to an upper middle class neighborhood i would say more but it think it would spoil the movie this movie do not just deal with race relation between white and black but also about relation with in the black community i do think that it be worth a chance if your not really interested in see another movie about race relation then this movie isnt for you  n  have be a marine i can tell you that the d i be a accurate a portrayal to date depict marine corp boot camp and how boy be turn into men jack webb be excellent a sgt jim moore a tough but fair drill instructor in paris island north carolina the film center on one recruit who doesnt seem to get with the program a more recent film full metal jacket also show life in basic training and be well worth view  n  every high praise word fell way short before the height of this movie this movie be the true example of how a psychological horror movie should be the plot seem to be a bit confuse at first view but it will definitely explain a bit about whats go on and you really want to view it for the second time but after second viewing you will start to join the piece together and then you will know how amaze a movie can be a word of advice for slasher flick fan stay away from this movie this be not your dumb as teenage slasher movie in which you just switch off your ain and sit in front of the screen just to see big b  bs and lot of blood if you want to heighten the psychological horror factor of this movie then watch it all alone with a great home theater system that support dolby digital or dts  ch without any of your ill mannered friend that crack joke on a really tense situation and dont forget to switch the light off my point on different aspect direction act atmosphere sound effect  total  n  ken burn baseball be a decent documentary     it present a clear origin of the game a great depiction of baseball early year and hero there plenty in this movie for any baseball fan     that say the film have several glare flaws hour be simply too long for the human attention span it clear that burn stretch his film out to fit his nine inning concept it not even a tight hour     the pace on every segment be slow almost morose     the music always nostalgic and wistful isnt baseball ever exciting and fun why be every player and their accomplishment present in the form of a tragedy talk head after talk head turn every pitch into an emotional hearteak yak about baseball a a metaphor baseball a americana the psychology and theology of baseball     enough this be syrupy mawkish drivel billy crystal be here to sell u all the yankee hokum he sell u before ken burn use the national anthem a the series theme song and manages to play take me out to the ballgame so many time you might vomit we get it dude clearly burn be a neohollywood fauxliberal so he spend probably a third of the film on the negro league     these segment be spend chastise white of yesterday for not be as openminded a kenny be today for shame he chide baseball for be segregate in the thirty and forty but fail to realize that america be segregate in those time burn fall head over heel in love with buck oneil a former negroleague player and drool over every piece of footage in which the elderly oneil wax poetic about his playing day nonsense     burn would have be good off with an adult to help him edit his creation down baseball wind up a mushy gushy civilrights propaganda disguise a americana it clear that burn be not a baseball fan     otherwise he would know we watch game laugh and cheer not weep and recite soliloquy     be you listen mr  burn theres no cry in baseball  n  quitting may be as much about exit a preordained identity a about drug withdrawal a a rural guy come to beijing class and success must have strike this young artist face on a an appeal to separate from his root and far surpass his

all of the cast and the lovely little steam train that play a such an important supporting role i confess i fell in love with roberta in and she still touch me today show on tv in new zealand on christmas day the nice present i could have have  n  if only i have read the review by alex sander sic on here rather than look at the rating of over from a select choice of the ignorant view public i would not have see this desecration alien be a fantastic dramatic and well make horror scifi predator be a great scifi action messabout i do really have only myself to blame though a i saw alien versus predator it too have an average grading of over star from the connoisseur of film that frequent this site stop reading now if you have any fear of this ever so suspense ridden plot be ruin for you right from the beginning this film be ridiculous no explanation be offer for the predator ship overrun not overrun by alien ok so maybe they be again go to throw alien down to earth to hunt them and something go wrong but how do this result in an alien predator hyid and why do the rest of the crew not realise sooner despite their great technology the start be actually the most coherent and interesting part of the film because we have some idea of who be who or what be what and perhaps why from then on it get really ridiculous i always leave my disbelief strictly suspend above the door of the screen before enter and collect it on the way out i couldnt here a father and son be hunt in the wood the damage ship crash land to from the view give i would calculate at the very least odd mile away through thick woodland the man and boy track there alone and find the ship and get face hug even at this point you feel very little for them mainly because the face hugger be almost comical rather than scary in their movement and action and the father seem like such an irresponsible dumb redneck muppet an edgy thrillertype scenario be introduce with an excon return to the town near the crash site to be meet by his somewhat emotionless dull now cop friend from the bus when i say introduce i mean a feeble attempt with crap actor and no feeling be play out a slasher horror element be then introduce with a sexy girl and the usual supposedly nerdy or somehow undesirable cute guy who get beat up by the over protective crazy nasty jock type american sportsman not a scottish man oh the cute not cute boy be the excons other by the way yes theyre clever these director others whose name i will research in order to avoid any other shite they put out again then a modern role reversal oh so boring attempt at pc ripley credential type character introduction come with a female soldier return home to her husband and child guess what happen next i wont tell you much more about the actual smile sadly to himself about the demise of storytelling in the large majority of recent film plot just in case you have get this far and be not the ightest star in the alienridden universe the predator be stupid for the reason state by the previous poster whose post i read too late the alien be bore the predatoralien be ridiculous the action be at time exploitative gratuitous disgust nonsense the hospital scene with the pregnant mother oh i be shock alright shock at how low some people will go to get what a scare some shock to titillate the perverse what if you really want to shock titillate and scare people who be not pregnant or expect father or who have no soul why not just have the alien predator shag the saucy woman and teenage girl rather than kill them the character have no depth and neither do the plot it film and pace badly it act by disinterested people not that i can blame them it further tarnish two rather interesting and good set of scifi character this film be rubbish and if you gain enjoyment from it i really have to worry about you if you havent see it then well please make your own decision ps do i even mention the way that train soldier be all kill in about second while amateur civilian survive throughout  n  even though i saw this film when i be very young i already know the story of wild the thieftaker and shepherd who famously escape from newgate prison apart from the liberty take right at the end the film more or less faithfully follow the true story the temptation to bend the fact which be the hallmark of so many socalled historical film be resist in this film and the film maker must be praise for that of the performance there be scarcely a poor performance and tommy steele be ideally cast also good be stanley baker a the thieftaker and alan badel be good a always because the film stick to the fact it make it suitable to be watch by all the family  n  go be the wonderful campiness of the original in place be a cgrade action noainer wich be not all bad but pale in comparison to the original all the meaningless sex and violence be go and replace with crappy joke and unexplained plot pointer see it but dont expect the thrill of the first  n  although most american have little knowledge of his work other than star war alec guinness produce an amazing body of workparticularly in the ssranging from drama to quirky comedy i particularly love his comedy a they be so welldone and seem so natural and real on the screenfar different from the usual fare from hollywood this be say this be the film that spark my interest in these movie it plot be so odd and cute that it be very unlikely the film would have be make anywhereexcept for ealing studioswhich have a particular fondness for little film like this one guinness be a nerdy little scientist that work for a textile company he want to experiment in order to create a synthetic faic that be indestructible though he be not work for the company a a researcher but for janitorial work so he tend to sneak into labs either during the day if no one suspect or at night and try his hand at invent repeatedly he be catch such a after he blow up the lab and give the boot until one day he actually succeed then despite the importance of the discovery he set off a completely unanticipated chain of eventsand then the fun begins the film be a wonderful satire that poke fun at industry union the government and people in general  n  victor mclaglens performance be one of the fine in film history i think we can all feel for gypo because weve all struggle with what be right and what isnt and be wrong this be one of the first arthouse picture to be release by a major american movie studio rko radio picture  joseph h  august cinematography be at it very best here however augusts stun portion be mostly overlook he didnt receive the oscar nomination he rightly deserved this be a psychological drama with thought philosophy sadness all convey

business decide to steal a large shipment of cash themselves but just a they get to first base with their plan everything unravels quickly with a plot like this youd think it couldnt be too bad at least for an action movie however in the first minute or more of this movie we see what appear to be normal everyday kind of guy they joke they laugh have a few drink together etc then we suddenly learn theyre planning to rob their own business the hero ty columbus short be suck into the scheme because of the cold cruel world even though he a decorated veteran nice guy and reliable employee oh my oh my then in the last minute of the film these former regular guy nearly all turn into moneycrazed psycho willing to butcher each other for cash in the last scene mike matt dillon go on a suicidal rampage for no other reason than to kill his former friend the viewer have no hint before this end that these men be this ruthless and bloodthirsty it utterly unbelievable and b movie be almost too kind for this sort of cheesy plot i would say dont waste your timetoo bad no one give laurence fishburne jean reno or fred ward the same advice before make this picture  n  the sexploitation movie era of the late sixty and early seventy begin with the allowance of gratuitous nudity in mainstream film and end with the legalization of hardcore porn it peak year be between and one of the most loved

prove it and her seemingly deliberate fade into obscurity right when her career be take off only heighten her mystique gary graver the director be also a talent probably too talented for the sexploitation genre and his skill combine with monica gayles screen presence make sandra the making of a woman a pleasantly enjoyable experience the film never drag and you wont have your finger press

interaction with the enemy during the civil war in kentucky this movie lessen the glamor of war show it effect on not only the soldier but the entire family unit a lot of today movie show war a an opportunity to highlight the hero and other glamorous feature of war but very little attempt to show the true effect war actually take on a community this movie attempt this through a retelling of a person memory of those day this movie be state to be loose translation of an actual event when in reality this movie be probably a factual reality of hundred perhaps thousand of actual event during the civil war i highly recommend those interested in our civil war to watch this movie  n  or anyone else have notice the fact that first bunch of episode be inspire too much by s flick i mean seriously wife who be try get someone else to murder his rich husband so she can claim his asset med student who be temporarily stop their heart to reach memory that be lose flatliners bunch of college body get together again to reminisce on the old day but be not fully comfortable because they do something in the past very bad thing groundhog day be one of my all time favorite movie sadly enough the writing staff behind his turd be bunch of lazy bastard who can not come up with their original scripts noble idea totally fubarred in it execution  n  elvira mistress of the dark be one of my fav movie it have every thing you would want in a film like great one liner sexy star and a outrageous story if you have not see it you be miss out on one of the great film make i cant wait till her new movie come out  n  i saw this movie on the hallmark channel and think it be wonderful especially since it be base on a true man pierce brosnan be very good a the loner english man who take on the persona of the half eed grey owl the photography be beautiful this movie make me do more research into this character archie belaney know simple a grey owl i want to read as much a i can about him at the time i do not know richard attenborough have direct it but i be not surprised i like all his movie whether he be act or direct i give it the high rating however i would have like to have see more in the movie about why he take on this persona a it only show the two aunt who raise him and his room in their house you cant go wrong with this movie if you be like me and enjoy a beautiful story without hear foul language and contrive special effect every few minute  n  despite have an absolutely horrid script more about that later this film be still vaguely watchable just because it star two excellent actor barbara stanwyck and henry fonda aside from one or two real stinker id probably watch just about anything with them in the film a i be a huge fan of hollywood golden age of the s and s  however no matter how much i love their film i just cant recommend this film the movie begin with fonda and stanwyck on vacation at some ski resort the two havent yet meet but the film begin loudly and obnoxiously with a scene in which fonda horribly yodel while ski it be do so unsubtly and make my teeth grind but i stick it outespecially when fonda fell into a snow bank and this stop the yodeling in hindsight perhaps i should have just turn it off then fonda be knock out in the fall and barbara go for help back at the ski lodge he seem okay but fortunately she be also a doctor and have him xrayed and nurse him back to health he in turn becomes infatuate with her and propose to her despite hardly know each other they marry and so far the film seem like a sweet but very slight romantic comedy once home however all isnt rosy a she jump right back into her job a a family doctor and he begin exhibit sign that he be a control and potentially dangerous man due to his jealousy the film play it all for laugh but frankly fondas behavior be really creepyspying on her and her male patient attack or threaten any man she treat trip a patient who already have a back injury and stomp into a surprise party and insist that everyone there men and woman be out to steal away his wife he come off a a combination of a sociopath and paranoid schizophrenic but it all suppose to be for laughs consider that he seem like a dangerous nut you would think that stanwyck would file for an annulment along with a restrain order but oddly she get mad but just cant stay mad at fonda because he so            i cant think of the right wordcreepy be all that come to mind later out of the blue multimillionaire fonda get a job work the counter at a department store then through magical thinking he and babs seem to assume his hostility and violent jealousy be all a thing of the pastso a job apparently cure anger and suspicion when this job fall through the film end with fonda buy his own hospital give barbara a job there and they live happily ever after they dont go any far with the story but i assume base on fonda character that he then spend most of his time a hospital administrator beat up all the male patients the first portion at the ski lodge and the next do not fit well together nor do the final horatio alger inspire section where the rich boy make good in the business world they be like three separate plot but despite this the most serious problem with the film be it seeming to excuse away domestic violence and delusional jealousy what a creepy little film thank goodness neither fonda nor stanwyck be know for this yechy film but for all their other lovely film  n  i find the critique of many imdb user a little harsh and in many case find that they crit the movie from a very professional viewpoint and not that of the guy on the street that want to sit and watch something just to get away from it all in this case however i have to say it be bad i be a scifi junkie and there be nothing in this movie that grab me for even one second there be no proper storyline i may be an idiot but i still do not know where the government be that be so worried about these pieces the pathetic attempt by the main character to put together these piece be scary half the time the two piece be already in place and he simply have to add the third a year old kid would have be able to put them together this movie be bad dominic  n  i be debate between this movie and but choose inglourious basterds due to it amazingly high imdb rating i must say now what a disappointment i expect a certain amount of gratuitous violence but i also expect a lot of witty dialog i get a huge dosage of the former but not nearly enough of the latter i felt shortchanged the ratio between violence to plot be very important and i think this movie get it totally wrong and the plot it that believable or really all that entertain either save your time and money i cant believe what this rating say for the gory and violent taste of the modern mass  n  bend it like beckham be pack with intriguing scene yet have an overall predictable stroy line it be about a girl call jess who be try to achieve her life long dream to become a famous soccer player and finally get the chance when offer a position on a local team there be so many boundary and limit that she face which hold her back yet she be still determine and strives i would recommend it for anyone who like a nice light movie and want to get inspire by what people can achieve the song choice be really good hush my child just move on up     to your destination and you make boundary and complication anyway hope that be at help to your need in a review bend it like beckham great flick  n  direct by diane keaton and adapt from a book by franz lidz a young mother selma lidz andie macdowell be battle a very serious illness and her self proclaim inventor husband sid john tururro be a little lacking in the emotion department unhappy with the new home situation their sensitive son steven nathan watt decide he want to stay with his two eccentric uncle danny michael richards and melvin lou cutell until his mom be well steven seem to be happy and even take interest in his strange uncle live habit he even decide he want to change his name to franz set in the early s this drama be a bit comedic     change that to zany not be a macdowell fan unstrung hero assures my attitude albeit i enjoy the film and it be not a total waste  n  perhaps the most gripping and intelligent of crooked cop movie be otto premingers where the sidewalk end from a really excellent script by ben hecht base on the novel night cry by frank rosenberg     dana andrew be the honest tough new york policeman always in trouble with his superior because he like his own strongarm method as much a he detest crook     when he hit someone his knuckle hurt     and the man he want to hit be a smooth villain gary merrill who point up the title why be you always try to push me in the gutter he ask andrew i have as much right on the sidewalk a you dana andrew obsession and neurosis be implant in his hidden painful discovery that he be the son of a thief     his deep hatred of criminal lead him to use their own illegal method to destroy them and the pursuit of justice become spoil in private vendetta     by a twist of irony unique to the film itself dana andrew and gene tierney of laura be united once more and andrews now seem to be play the same detective a few year later but no longer the romantic beaten down by his job by the cheap crook     this time he go too far and accidentally kill a suspect     the killing be accidental the victim worthless yet it be a crime that he know can eak him or send him to jail     use his knowledge of police procedure he cover up his part in the crime plant false clue and try to implicate a gang leader but can not avoid investigate the case himself     the double tension of follow the large case through to it conclusion without implicate himself in the murder be beautifully maintain and the final solution be both logical satisfying and in no way a compromise     the film be one of the best detective film of the s with curious moral value also one of premingers best     preminger use a powerful storytelling technique project pretentious camera angle and peculiar touch of the bizarre in order to externalize his suspense in realism      n  in sum overlong and fill with more subplots than swiss cheese have hole the director and cowriter say he want to mix genre in this case drama and comedy well at least here these two mix like vinegar and oil to boot the comedy be not very funny and juvenile additionally the film be not really realistic liberty be take regard the legal system in commit french citizen against their will and the apparent ease of abscond with drug in french hospital i watch this film on my big screen tv at home and find myself shout at the film to move on eventually toward the end i fast forward the final long speech one of the main character make to his exlovers son by that time i be wear out by the preposterous confused plot that deal with a dead lover marriage of convenience and a nutty exlover at time the plot divert to the family of the two main character and then revert back to one of them either ismael or primarily nora to the detriment of the audience viewpoint keep change from nora and ismael her exlover confine against his will in a psychiatric hospital there probably be two potentially interesting film here neither of which be well developed the epilogue do not really wrap up many of the subplots and seem to want the viewer to believe nora somehow will find happiness although give her circumstance in real life the chance be equivalent to a snow ball chance in hell the actor do their best and be appeal but this be not enough to overcome all the glare fault of poor write editing and lack of focus  n  incomprehensibly dreadful mishmash of the probably most notorious of all roman emperor who go insane leave infamous party orgy and ruthless killing in his path     i know there be several version of this and this be base on the min one that i watch but i cant fathom how that possibly can make any difference to lift the rest of this movie out of the muck id heard for long about the alleged shocking content of sex nudity which honestly there isnt much of here at all and bore when there be and blood but beware it the technical production amateurishness that well and truly shock here everything look plain and simply like a junior film school flunk project camerawork be hopelessly inept full of strange zoom fail framing and confuse pan to and from what mostly look like a huge theater stage complete with a grainy cheapish photo quality lighting and color scheme be terrible and uneven be it day or night be they in or outside have they change scene who be or be mean to be in the shot editing be the final sin here make a confusing mess of everything with randomly jumpy cutaway continuity flaw and random transition that destroy any chance of momentum story progression and involvement there be potentially interesting dialog and an equally interesting true historical story     but these fault distract so much it tragic a story with so many possibility to be great be just one gargantuan burnt and fellinilike turkey thats only good for a few gobblelaughs and peter otoole who make a most memorable tiberius oh yes which ings u to the bigname actor id like to line them all up one by one and just ask who do you get free access to bonk in the orgy to be a part of this there ive waste enough line on one of the truly bad film of all time period out of from ozjeppe  n  do anyone edit this film or be it only the dvd release that have huge thirty second gap between scene it ok though i fell asleep watch it the first time then i fell asleep the second time and the third time the plot be actually not the bad ive see but it close the acting be not the bad ive see either     but it close the production     well i can honestly say that it be the bad i have ever see in my life not try to be spiteful but unhinged could have use some more production please dont think im a hater of horror film or even that i didnt enjoy this film i just felt i be laugh at the film much more than i felt i be laugh along with it the gruesome moment be not too poorly do but could have be do well even with a shoestring budget characters seem awkwardly develop or ignore all together twist end be pretty bad and the exposition take forever without expose much id recommend avoid this movie    n  rid high on the success of rebel without a cause come a tidal wave of teen movie arguably this be one of the best a very young mcarthur excels here a the not really too troubled teen the story concentrate more on perception of delinquency than any traumatic occurrence the support cast be memorable frankenheimer directs like an old pro just a story of a young man that find others take his action much too seriously  n  most of the comment on this movie be positive so i thought i would try and redress the balance i come out of this movie wonder what be go on i now know and still consider it to be a poor movie i intially discount a dream sequence a that seem too obvious i be glad that i have a free ticket to the movie or i would have ask for my money back movie reviewer and critic love this movie which only confirm to me that most of them would rather sound intelligent than review how an audience may enjoy a film the rating this movie have be so misleading in year time this film will not compare to true great such a the godfather the film do have fine performance from both the lead but that isnt enough to save the film nor be the lesbian scene  n  pepe le moko play by charles boyer be some sort of international criminal mastermind want in country throughout europe and to stay free he hole himself up in the casbah a mysterious part of algiers where even the police be reluctant to go until a senior officer be send from paris to capture le moko once and for all for le moko although the casbah allow him to remain out of police custody it also become a sort of prison at the same time a place he cant leave because the moment he do he know hell be arrested boyers performance be good and i can understand why he be nominate for an oscar he capture the essence of such a character a perfect combination of very dangerous and yet very classy at the same time the movie itself unfortunately be quite a letdown a number of part of the story seem inconsistent of which ill mention two first be the idea that the police wouldnt enter the casbah that be state pretty clearly at the beginning of the film by the local commander and yet repeat reference in the movie suggest that in fact the police do enter the casbah fairly regularly so neither the suggestion by commissioner janvier that the police wouldnt enter nor the statement by inspector slimane also a decent performance by joseph calleia that they could get into the casbah but not out seem to make much sense i also find it difficult to believe that le moko harden criminal mastermind that he be could be so quickly sweep off his foot by gaby hedy lamarr to the point where he entertain the local populace by sing love song and then leave the casbah to find her essentially give himself up i understand the irony of the final few scene of course a pepe leave the freedom of his prison the casbah only to find real freedom in his capture because he shot and kill by the police i just find it impossible to believe that someone like le moko would fall into such a trap this be worth watch for boyer and to a less extent calleia but the story be disappointing and inconsistent  n  man with the scream brain certainly isnt a perfect movie but im pretty sure it be never mean to be anything more than a star vehicle for bruce campbell mean it work a kind of a summary of his entire career slapstick sarcasm cheese action and happy ending campbell be a a writer uneventhere be lot of thing in the story that dont make a great deal of sense why do the robot suddenly have east merely because a female ain have be implant into it and some of the scene feel like retread of other good incarnation the scene in the restaurant where yegor and william battle for control of williams body be straight out of evil dead ii there be however lot of little touch and nonsequiturs that feel rather illiant such a when william be in the height of his panic and scream at a statue what be you look at the movie look like a scifi channel original probably because it be the acting be actually pretty good i particularly enjoy tamara gorski a tatoya she be ruthless and cunning yes but seem to have a tragic air about her in certain moment that the story never explore ted raimi handle the standard bumbling assistant role admirably enough and bruce be funny a the arrogant sardonic condescend american jerk now that he write his own film youd think hed give himself a role that he hasnt be typecast in already man with the scream brain be a bizarre nonsensical bmovie that ought to be enjoyable for anybody who can avoid take a cinematic experience too seriously  n  you should never ever even consider to watch this movie it be absolutely awful this isnt an overstatement it be so unbelievable and exaggerate it get bore it be just a movie where they have take story and plot from several movie and put it together in one they writer hasnt be able to pull it off in a good way if youd like to see pretty girl in bikini and no ain this might be the movie for you but still you should plug your ear and just watch it not worth listen p there be so many great movie out there and if i could choose one this would be the last movie i would pick but all in all it your choice enjoy  n  tell the truth i   m a bit stun to see all these positive review by so many people which be also the main reason why i actually decide to see this movie and after have see it i be really a disappointed and this come from the guy that love this genre of movie i   m surprise at this movie all completely      it be like a kid   s movie with nudity for absolutely no reason and it all involve little child curse and swear i   m not at all righteous but this have really go too far in my account synopsis the story about two guy get send to the big other program for their reckless behavior there they meet up with one kid with boobs obsession and the other be a medieval freak just the name it self be not really connect with the story at all they be not be a role model and or do anything but to serve their time for what they have do the story be very predictable though expect and the humor be lame and haven   t we already see the same character play by mc lovin    in so many other movie like sasquatch gang i think i laugh thrice and almost fell a sleep well the casting be alright after all he be the one that produce the screenplay and the acting be soso a expect when you   re watch this type of movie and the direction what do one expect this be the same guy who ought u wet hot american summer and that movie also suck but somehow he always manage to ing in some star to attract his horrendous movie anyway i felt not total riff off but a completely waste of time only the naked scene seem to be the best part in the movie can   t really see any point why i should recommend this to anyone pros elizabeth bank two topless scenes cons not funny dreadful story nudity and kid do not mix together rating grade f  n  this film hold my interest enough to watch it several time the plot have hole but the lead performer make it work catherine mary stewart julia keridge do a great job a a woman of who have sacrifice everything else to become a physician she work year to earn the money to go to medical school she be perform illiantly in her residency and be just about to take her board exam and realize her dream meanwhile julias sister and otherinlaw be murder and a the near living relative she be compel to take in her niece amanda arlen aguayostewart to avoid have her become a ward of the state amanda be about year old from her appearance amanda be so traumatized from her parent murder that she have become mute needless to say julias hour day get long care for amanda rob lowe play kevin finney a charming neighbor man in their apartment building who work his way into the life of julia and amanda he be always there with a trick or a joke to help amanda deal with her distress amanda really start to warm up to kevin a the film progress perhaps more than to her aunt julia start to rely on kevin to take some of the load of care for amanda a she attempt to handle her case load and prepare for her board examination kevin be always there whenever some crisis erupts for julia the chemistry between rob and catherine mary be great you keep watch to see them get together before the end of the film the chemistry between rob and arlen be good as well arlen manage to convey quite a lot without the benefit of word the plot have julia and amanda gradually warm up to each other you can see them work out a relationship a the film progresses we discover that julias sister and otherinlaw the meyers be involve in industrial espionage they steal an extremely valuable prototype microchip from their employer they have three associate who intend to share the proceeds of the theft julia discovers that the meyers be plan to skip the country under assumed identity the plot be unclear whether the meyers intend to double cross their associate or be themselves double crossed in any case the meyers be murder in their home by of their former associate the killer make no attempt to extract the location of the microchip from the meyers before kill them the killer search the home and fail to find their prize they leave a living witness to their crime amanda the killer then spend the remainder of the film make clumsy attempt to extract the microchip from julia and amanda who have no idea where the prize be locate eventually the killer kidnap amanda in hope she know something about the microchip location eventually julia discovers the truth about kevin he be an investigator hire to recover the steal microchip after some rough moment in the relationship they manage to rescue amanda and dispatch the bad guy the predictable end have the three form a family and move happily into a future together what strike me about the plot be major hole kevin move into the same apartment building a julia and amanda the day after the murder of the meyers how do he know that the microchip be not already in the hand of the killer the killer blithely leave fingerprint at the murder scene with no concern for conceal their identity the killer that pretend to be a psychiatrist be reveal to amanda by the remnant of red paint from the murder scene on his shoe sol he be not show in the murder scene at the start of the film there be other weakness along these line too numerous to mention the film could have be a lot well if the script have be refine more before film filling in the plot hole would have add little expense and greatly improve the effort  n  like the previous poster i be from northern vermont and i be incline to like this film however not since red zone cuba have i see such a confusing plot the thing the people to bootleg make no sense two of the gang paddle across the border send a second party across in a car uhm why then they meet two others and drive up at night in to the bad guy hideout in a luxury packard wouldnt just two people in a flatbed truck make more sense then park outside the garage that hold the targeted hooch the four fall asleep when they waken in the morning and and start haul the whiskey out of course theyre spot and shot at lose some of their precious cargo in the process then two of the smuggler put the whiskey in a boat and float it over the border again why i be tell by someone whose great uncle really do smuggle in the area all one need be to drive a vehicle that could outrun than the u s  canada border patrol which back then have a fraction of the resource it have now and dont get me start on the last half hour which make no sense whatsoever the only good thing i can say about the film be that kris kristopherson have actually grow some charisma with the year  n  may contain spoiler this movie be the bad movie ever i couldnt even watch it all it be so bad this film be actually bad than scarecrow slayer which be say a whole lot this be bad than terror toon which at least terror toon be funny at time not even the gore in the film be good the shooting be fake and the acting be bad please do yourself a favor and skip this one if you see it at the rental store then run the other way there be nothing good about this film at all if you want to see a good scarecrow movie then watch night of the scarecrow or pumpkin head if you want to see an ok new cheesy movie then watch scarecrow i rate this movie a out of thats how horrible this film really be the bad movie ever  n  watch this last night and be bowl over by the heartfelt story line the excellent character development and the good karmic vibe emanate from the acting and movie a a whole without give away too much of the plot it begin with an ordinary joe who commute to his office job every day who become inspire to take dance lesson along the way the protagonist and the assorted character he meet in his quest to be smooth on the dance floor learn lesson about others and about themselves the story have a prologue about what dance in japan symbolize sociologically so it isnt exactly as simple to learn to dance in japan a it be here in the u s  the film be lighthearted youll laugh out loud at some of the sight gag yet it be also dignify in a way hard to describe all of the film character be take seriously a they be and none be diminish because of their imperfections ive be think about take social dance class with some friend it just so happen a friend lent me the video on learn to dance be this synchronous or what i think so because now im really geeked to give it a try watch this wonderful family film small child might not get it but teens certainly would and smile at the genuine caring you see show in it time and again why they would make a remake of shall we dance be a mystery a it be perfect asis  n  recap something mysteriously dense that transmit radio signal be discover in the ice of antarctica the mysterious block be dig out and ought to a research station on antarctica julian rome a former setiworker be ought in to decipher the message problem be that one of the researcher be a old girlfriend of his and the situation quickly turn awkward especially since the other female researcher practically throw themselves at him and the block of ice with the thing inside be melt unnaturally quickly soon the object be in the open the mystery continue though a the object generate a huge amount of electricity it be decide to open the object but just before that be do julian decode the signal do not open but too late and the object explodes a it be finally eached and two thing unleash on earth the first be an alien that have be dormant in the object and the other be a virus that instantly kill the research staff and washington that be suspiciously update on this historic event decides that those thing can not be unleash upon the earth so a russian nuclear submarine carry nuclear weapon be send to antarctica comments the movie hold a few surprise one be carl lewis who surprisingly put in a good acting performance and the other be that the special effect that be beautiful well work through and a lot good than expect unfortunately the story hold a lot of surprise of it own and this time not in a good way actually it be so full of plot hole that sometimes the movie seem to consist of almost randomly connect scene it be never really explain why washington know so much why washington be able to command russian submarine why the object be in the antarctic and have wake up now it be really puzzle that the alien pod be transmit in understandable english some might want to explain this with that the alien have be to earth before and know the language and obviously chose english why but then it be very confusing why the nice alien that apparently want to save the earth from the virus send their do not open message encode and finally the end be as open a an end can be the movie be a little entertaining but too much energy from me must be divert to fill in the void in the plot therefore the total impression of the movie be not too good    n  this movie feature charlie spradling dancing in a strip club beyond that it feature a truly bad script with dull unrealistic dialogue that it get a many positive vote suggest some people may be joke  n  have i check imdb before rent this dvd from netflix id have a couple of hour of my life back im frankly suspicious when i see that a film director also write it in this case accord to the credit the same guy be writter and director unfortunately an indication of the overall quality of this production there be a few interesting moment e g judy tenutas scene remind of her early comedy routine tout judyism which lead me to rate this two star rather than one those moment however be few and far between     and i almost do not get to see them because the opening sequence be nearly incomprehensible to me not to mention reprehensible in it violence i admit i go back to watch that part again to see if i have miss something that would help me figure it out once id see the whole thing nope though i at least recognize who the character be who would turn out to be important later the spin camera technique be overuse and essentially pointless i find myself talk to the tv screen what or for goodness sake get on with it not recommend  n  the endless bound of our inhumanity to our own kind never fail to stun me this truly astonishing story of a horrifically abuse and largely unheardof population be compel welldocumented and enrage a an american i be constantly humiliate by my country behaviour and this be just another in our long catalogue of international debasement we suck this be probably the first john pilger documentary ive see but it immediately make me want to see what else hes do my only complaint and the reason i give this film only out of be that pilger show u this travesty and the appalling collaboration of the u and uk government demand that we viewers citizens be complicit in our own inaction     but make no suggestion of how to help i dont know about britain but america make it nearly impossible for the citizenry to take part in their government do a gesture in the right direction might help these islander cause  n  this flick be so bad it beyond belief even for an independent low budget film     it just well sucks i cant even believe even troma would put out such crap i have be a fan of some troma flick for year toxic avengersqueeze playrockabilly vampire to name a few  but lloyd come onthis go way beyond the boundary of any taste it feature some of the bad act imaginable i think it would have be possible to find unemployed street people who could have be as good     ohwait that be what they did i mean itthese character have negative charisma with any luck the producer and director of this film will have a huge karmic debt because of this atrocity as will the special effect people but beyond the terrible acting and the horrid special effectsthe dialogue be absolutely traumatic to the ears the script be full of plot hole the size of alaska and there be severe continuity problems the bad part however be that it not entertain in even the small way and this be the most unforgivable sin in film making but dont take my word for it go out and waste four buck rent it just dont say i didnt warn you  n  this be a very memorable spaghetti western it have a great storyline interest character and some very good act especially from rosalba neri her role a the evil villainess in this film be truly classic she steal every scene she be in and express so much with her face and eye even when shes not speak her performance be very believable she manage to be quite mesmerize without be over the top not that theres anything wrong with be over the top mark damon be surprisingly good in this movie too the music score be excellent and the theme song be the kind that will be play in your head constantly for day after see the movie whether you want it to or not there be a couple of part that be very amuse i especially like the part where rosalba neri undress in front of the parrot theres also lot of slick gunplay thats very well done i would probably have give this movie or star if it wasnt for two thing the first be a silly bar room awl that occur about minute into the film this be one of the most ridiculous look fight i have ever see in a movie it be very poorly choreograph and look more like a dance number from a bad musical than any kind of a real fight one might be able to overlook this if it be a terence hill bud spencer comedy but this be a more serious western and the awl really need to be more realistic the other thing that annoy me about this movie be yumas cowardly mexican sidekick i guess he be suppose to be comic relief or something but the character be just plain stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this and he wasnt at all funny all i can say be where be tuco when you need him all that have be say let me assure everyone read this that johnny yuma be a classic spaghetti western despite the fault i have mention and all fan of the genre need to see this movie  n  the plot michael linnett connors have do everything in film but direct and be look for his st big chance he discover molly in a play and at once know she will be a big film star he sign her to a contract with the stipulation that he must direct the producer agree and their big time career be under way what follow be a recreation of the silent film era and early sound movie with great emphasis on comedy and oh yes there romance and a little sadness too the performance by don ameche and alice fay be top notch the music be a real plus too with some old familiar tune hear lot of dvd extra as well in this restored version release in it must be emphasize that this movie be a story st not just a tribute to silent film later year would ing similar film such a singin in the rain dick van dykecarl reiners the comic what be special about this film though be recreate silent movie in we see portion of them a the cinema audience would in that bygone era although some sound effect be include in glorious b w while the rest of the movie be in pristine color one of the great in the silent era buster keaton who at this point be on an uphill climb be use superbly in silent film recreate scene and he be on the top of his game it be say that he have some input on his scene as well but the real reason to watch the movie if your a motion picture history fan be that beyond everything else hollywood cavalcade be mack sennett film legacy it doesnt take a genius to realize this movie be a positive reworking of mack sennett and mabel normands life the character michael linnett connors be mack sennett whose real name be michael sinnott and molly of course be mabel sennett have the pie throw the bathing beauty and keystone cop he work with buster keaton ben turpin cameo roscoe fatty arbuckle body double and fell in love with his lead lady not only all that but sennett be technical adviser for this film and appear in it as well a most film viewer today prefer sound feature those who be associate with short subject and silents be leave out to pasture a mack sennett fell into that category it be fortunate that there be hollywood cavalcade sennett be of course very instrumental in the evolution of comedy in movie his career start in a an actor then writer director producer he semi retire in with about film to his credit he have work with the best such a charlie chaplin gloria swanson bing crosby w c  field keaton harry langdon arbuckle and even roy rogers in way up thar  as film comedy be an extremely difficult path to continue for an entire career mack play it wise do only selective work for the next year in he have receive an academy award in the short subject category and another in for a lifetime of work in the s his presence be still felt e g here come the coeds where a recreation of the oyster soup scene use in mack wander willies be do in the road to hollywood use some of sennetts crosby film year later ought some nostalgia with the film down memory lane in which he participate with his knack of always associate with the right people a guest role with the eternally popular lawrence welk his radio show come about later in the year ought a rerelease of his great triumph tillies puncture romance with sound in he be honor on tv this be your life then his autobiography the king of comedy which be a great companion piece to hollywood cavalcade be publish ought a more concrete association with abbott costello a he have a cameo in a c meet the keystone kops finally in another tribute with the compilation film the golden age of comedy so when you watch hollywood cavalcade it be the legacy of a motion picture pioneer in the film at the banquet scene the camera pan over the guest at a long table a we get to the silver haired mack he alone turn his head to the camera a if to say here i be when he rise to give a speech a short while later he be at his most subdue underplay the word give him a if to mentally convey i know my influence on comedy will never end but will people forget mack sennett the individual maybe this movie will help  n  it get to be a running joke around bonanza about how fatal it be for any woman to get involve with any cartwright men after all ben cartwright be three time a widower with a son by each marriage and any woman who get involve with adam ho and little joe be go to end up die because we couldnt get rid of the formula of the widower and the three son that start this classic tv western perhaps if bonanza be be do today the writer would have have revolving woman character who come in and out of the life of the cartwright people have relationship some go good some not so good it just life and be less demanding of our hero today so if a relationship with one of them go south we dont have to kill the character off to keep the survivor nobility intact but thats if bonanza be do today but we be still expect a lot from our western hero and bonanza though it take a while to take hold and a change of view time from nbc certainly help the secret of bonanza success be the noble patriarch ben cartwright and his stalwart son ben cartwright be the ideal tv dad in any genre you want to name his whole life be spend in the hard work of building that immense ponderosa spread for his three child the kid be all different in personality but all come together in a pinch the cartwright become and still be an american institution i daresay more people care about this family than the kennedy just the popularity that bonanza have in syndication testifies to that pernell roberts a old son adam be write out of the show rumor have it he didnt care for the noble cartwright character which he felt border on sanctimonious perhaps if it be do now hed have like it well in the way i describe this be just the beginning for michael landon how many people get three hit tv show to their credit landon also have highway to heaven and little house on the prarie where he have creative control little joe be the young most hot head but the most romantic of the cartwright when robert leave the show keep go with the two young son but when big dan blocker leave the heart go out of bonanza other character have be add on by that time david canary tim matheson and ben cartwright adopt young mitch vogel but big loyal but a little thick ho be easily the most lovable of the cartwright his sudden demise after surgery leave too big a hole in that family so the cartwright of the ponderosa have pass into history i get a real taste of how america take the cartwright to heart when i visit the real virginia city it doesnt look anything like what you see in bonanza but near lake tahoe just about where you see the ponderosa on the map at the opening credit be the cartwright home the set maintain and open a a tourist attraction like baker street for sherlock holmes fan the ranchhouse and the cartwright be real and if they werent real they should have be  n  year ago when darling lili play on tv it be always the pan and scan version which i hat and decide to wait and see the film in it proper widescreen format so when i saw an inexpensive dvd of this julie andrews blake edward opus i decide to purchase and watch it once and for all boy what a terrible film it so bad and on so many level that i really do not know where to start in describe where and when it go so horribly wrong look at it now it obvious to any fan of movie that blake edward create this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other director have strike gold with andrew in musical mary poppins sound of music thoroughly modern millie etc but also because andrew be snub from star in project make famous on stage by julie herself camelot my fair lady etc because hollywood think she wasnt sexy or glamorous enough so blake create this stillborn effort to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy story war movie romance slapstick comedy musical darling lili suffers from multiple personality never know who or what it be some specific scene be good or effective but a a whole it just doesnt work at all to a point of it be very embarrassing mind you the version on the dvd be the director cut or in this case let salvage whatever we can from this notorious box office flop in release the dvd edward cut scene from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version the film move along with no idea of what it be we be minute into it and we still dont know whats go on or why be watch whats go what kind of spy be lili how powerful be she be she ever responsible for someone death instead we watch a thoroughly bore look rock hudson try to woo a thoroughly bore look julie andrew thing arent help much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love why do julie fall for hudson why him and not other men she get involve with there should have be one of her ex hang around try to win her back or try to decipher her secret this would have give u some much need contrast to the muddle action it would also have give u some impetuous to the sluggish proceeding theres no catalyst in this story one only have to look at the cut scene to clearly see that edward and the writer just come up with idea inspire by andrew and edward previous successes the best or bad example be the scene when andrew and hudson follow a group of child who sing in the middle of a forest edward channel sound of music it no wonder he remove it from the dvd back in that scene might have work on a certain level but today that moment reek of desperation there be other plot element directly inspire by andrews edwards other film the endless scene of dogfight be inspire by the much good modern millie the musical moment ill give you three guess be create just to make fun of july mary poppins persona which be turn raunchy with julie do a striptease in the act the end bird eye view of julie run towards hudson plane be another wink at sound of music the whole thing be confuse julie play a singer bear from a german father and british mother who live in england but sing her english song in paris you never know exactly where the story take place some moment be just badly edit like when julie and her uncle be on horseback they talk and talk and then julie suddenly sprint off in midsentence im like what happen here the comedy bit be unfunny and cringeworthy every scene with the french police be pathetic wheres peter seller when you really need him the action be stupid beyond belief when julie and her uncle be on their way to germany on that train hudson squadron shoots round of bullet at the train almost kill lili in the process brilliant whats also funny about that scene be the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning thats one slow move train there the musical moment the beginning be the best part of the entire film and the reason i give this film star but it effect be diminish considerably because it repeat at the end speaking of redundant do we really need to see a cancan dance crepe suzette strip scene and julie strip too the girl in no man land be ok even if it bleeding obvious but that moment just doesnt make any sense whatsoever because lili sings it to a group of injured soldier at a french hospital make me wonder how many soldier there be injure indirectly by the result of her spy the whole project be listless and without energy the romance be unbelievable rock hudson be way too old and tire look check out the museum scene julie look daze like shes on valium but what really kill this illconceived project be julie play a german spy edward desperately want to dispel the mary poppins syndrome afflict his wife and believe that play a traitor be a good career decision as much a i like julie shes no greta garbo who pull it off so beautifully in mata hari funny enough even if julie play a german spy she still come across a cloying and cute how bad be darling lili even after year since it release blake edward felt he still need to work on it for it dvd release  n  this series make for televisi  n espa  ola tve be basically a series of chapter in the life of an ordinary family in primarily a see through the eye of the young son based on a background of historical event such a the may student uprise in france the decay franco regime the war in vietnam the rise of imperialism and others specifically relate to spanish life at that particular moment one might regard this series a a simple compilation of characteristic foible which make themselves so apparent in this kind of entertainment generally treat in a lightweight vein though not lack in certain moment which might be call dramatic the series would seem to be aim at people of around fifty who can rember those time a it should be state anyone young either chooses to ignore such happening or be busily occupy in other things the best thing that can be say of this series be ana duatos r  le a mother of three child she play the part of the total housewife of the time really well manifest that peculiar spanish penchant especially noticeable among woman of let all her thinking and her doings be carry forward by the impetus of her heart without any resorting to the use of the ain a we say in spain common sense be one of the least common sens imanol arias offer very little apart from not be his usual stereotype hard policeman a in other television series indeed a an actor he should not be trust in anything which be not a tv series his resource be too limited however his part a father of the workingclass household be not at all bad not really recommendable for other audience even spanishspeakers in latin america the theme be all too parochially relate to a specific spot in contemporary spanish history such that if the viewer be not live here at that time he will miss most of the reference it be even probable that certain situation which cause a few spanish smile would not mean anything to other viewer  n  i want the minute of my life back that be waste on this pathetic excuse for a movie the acting be horrific i use to be a fan of cameron diaz and vincent donofrio i will never look at them the same again keanu reef and dan aykroyd be not a surprise everyone know they never could act thankfully only dan attempt an accent his accent be a disaster a expect i think he be either confuse about the location of the film or have never actually speak to anyone from minnesota i hope this review help anyone who be undecided about what to do with their precious time the only reason i be able to sit through the whole movie be because i be stick somewhere without anything well to watch or read  n  one of my favorite movie which have be overlook by too many movie goer an observation which mystifies me not only direct by the acclaimed ang leeit have many young actor who be to become major star e g tobey maguire before spiderman skeet ulrich before jericho jonathan rhys meyers before tudor james caviezel simon baker mark ruffalo jeffrey wright tom wilkinson and jewel all of the acting be superb and each of the actor mention give memorable performance especially meyers who portray an evil villain who kill for the sake of killing when the biography and accomplishment of the director even when he win an academy award and the actor be list this film be usually omit from their past performance i discover the film on dvd by accident and it become one of my most often watched film however it be seldom every see on cable i look forward to read what others suggest be the reason this film be not well know  n  it nice to see a romantic comedy that do not have the prissy man lead this have solid act from both male lead and also from the female lead and although the story be a little long and a little clich   you cant help but like it i think the story be a little rush at the end but extend that would have make the story even longer superior to other romantic comedy such a day with mr arrogant and possibly tie with my tutor friend it would make an interesting introduction to korean cinema not as great a my sassy girl but still good  n  of all the movie of the seventy none capture to truest essence of the good versus evil battle a do the sentinel i mean yes there be movie like the exorcist and other one but none of them capture the human element of the protagonist like this one if you have time check this one out you may not be able to get past the dated device a such but this be a story worth get into then there be all the star and soontobe star my absolute favorite be eli wallach sylvia mile and burgess meredith then there be the subtle clue that lead to whats go on too pay close attention i have to watch it four time to catch on to all the small weird statement like black and white cat black and white cake plus the book be really good a well im just sorry that theyre not go to turn the second book into a film it so scary that it would outdo this movie  n  this be apparently the second remake of this film have be film before in and and in so many way it remind me of the late film a yank at oxford both film concern a conceited blowhard who arrive at one of the top school in the world and both ultimately show the blowhard slowly learn about teamwork and decency in this film william haines be tom brown and his main rival bob be play by france x  bushman and in a supporting role be jack pickfordalways remember a the other of mary of these three pickford come off the best a the sympathetic loser who become tom palhe actually have a few decent scene as well a a dramatic moment just before the big game all the standard clich  s be there and the movie because it be do so many time before and since offer few surprise however it be pleasant film and be enjoyable viewing in my opinion for a good silent college film try harold lloyd the freshmanits football scene be frankly more exciting and harold be far more likable and sympathetic than the annoy tom brown the freshman be probably the best college picture you can find from the era another reason why brown at harvard be a less picture be that william haines play essentially the same unlikable and bombastic character with the same plot again and again and again such a in westpoint and the smart set among others and if youve see one of these film youve see them all well make but certainly not original and because it be just a rehash of his other film anyone give the film a score of be strongly advise to see these other films     i just check and saw this this small film be the high rat film on imdb from the talk about overrate there be dozen and dozen of good filmshow this film get to be be anyones guess  n  this movie illustrate like no other the state of the australian film industry and everything thats hold it back awesome talent outstanding performance particularly by victoria hill but a let down in practically every other way an adaptation of sort it ought nothing new to macbeth no set it in presentday australia be not enough and essentially completely fail to justify it existence apart from let face it completely unnecessarily pay homage to the original work if there one body of work that have be do and do and do and do it shakespeare so any adaptation if it not to be a selfindulgent and pointless exercise need to at least ing some new interpretation to the work and thats what this macbeth fail to do a it be do this film have no contemporary relevance whatsoever it the same piece that we have see countless too many time before except with gun and in different outfits apart from the fundamental blunder no other way to put it of keep the original shakespearian dialogue one of the more cringeful moment of the movie be the prolonged and incredibly boring slow motion shoot out towards the end during which i completely tune out even though i be look at the screen i never think i have a short attention span but there you go i suppose the movie succeed on it own very limited term but a australia continue to produce worldclass act talent it moviemakers need to stop be proud of succeed on limited term and actually set high enough standard to show that they respect for the kind of act talent they work with a shame an absolute shame  n  owen love his mamma     only hed love her good six foot under in this dark laughoutloud comedy that both star and be direct by danny devito with admirable assist from billy crystal and anne ramsey in the title role throw momma from the train be a terrific comedy even if it isnt a great film it too shallow in part and the end feel less organic than tack on but it a gutsplitting ride most of the way with crystal and devito employ great screen chemistry while work their own separate comic take on the essence of be a struggle writer devito be avid but untalented crystal be block and bitter  crystals professor donner believe his exwife steal his book the unfortunately title hot fire and cant write more than the opening line of his next book which doesnt come easy he teach a creative writing class of bud mediocrity include a middleaged woman who write tom clancytype fiction but doesnt know what that thing be the submarine captain speaks through and an upholstery salesman who want to write the story of his life mr  pinsky be probably the funny character for laughsperminutesonscreen an ascotwearing weirdo who see literature a an excuse to write his opus girl id like to pork then there devitos owen lift who call himself professor donners star pupil even though the teacher wont read his work in class owen be a somewhat unusual character to star in a movie a manchild in his late s who live with his overbear mother anne ramsey who call him lardass and other endear sentiment in any other movie wed be ask to feel sorry for owen but throw momma from the train pile lifes cruelty onto this sad sack for laugh and expect u to go along thats one big reason why this film probably lose a lot of people for those of u who enjoy the humor of this character even identify with him and take the rest of what we see here a a lark it not a big a stretch to go along with the big gambit this comedy take ask u to watch in amusement while owen enlists professor donners help in a plan to kill his mother actually he first go to hawaii to kill donners hat ex then tell the professor it his turn to kill mrs  lift swap murder a see in hitchcock stranger on a train as a director devito not only complement his actor performance with scenesetting that place the accent on dialogue he make some bold visual statement throw in bit of amuse unreality to keep the audience on it toe and away from take thing too seriously also help matter be writer stu silver who keep the laugh come with his quotable patter you get rat the size of oldsmobiles here shes not a woman     shes the terminator one little murder and im jack the ripper those be all crystal word but some of the funny line which work only in context but absolutely kill be devitos and ramseys apparently silver never write another screenplay after this accord to the imdb and thats a shame because he have real talent for it the best scene in this movie when crystal meet ramsey be actually use in it entirety a a theatrical come attraction presentation the only time ive see a movie promote that way owen introduce the professor to his mother a cousin patty and when momma say he doesnt have a cousin patty panicky owen lose it you lie to me he yell out slam the professor forehead with a pan of course in reality the professor wouldnt groan out something witty from the floor but throw momma from the train work effectively at such moment when play it looney tune vibe for all it worth devito hasnt disappear from film of course but it a mystery why he hasnt really follow up on the directorial promise of this movie maybe it because a throw momma from the train lack of mainstream success show his kind of vision isnt to everyones taste thats too bad for those of u who can watch this over and over and like it  n  a compelling thriller december author littlehammer from united statesjust causestarring sean connerylaurence fishburne and blair underwood a liberalthough

if theyre go to get the right sort of reputation for themselves this film be set in glasgow although only a couple of secondary character have anything approach a scottish accent the premise about people whos life be go nowhere who all meet up in the same cafe in the early hour of the morning a they have night job could have make for a really funny insightful quirky cultish film instead we have a group of selfobsessed saddos and a plot which have be so do to bit im suprised it hasnt be ban x and y be friends x be sleep with z  y sleep with z as well oh you figure it out a total waste of time painful dialogue it sound like something that a group of year old would have write for a gcse drama project the female character be completely superfluous just write in a a token female in the hope that woman would be cajole into see it if youre the sort of thicko lad who laugh at beer advert and can usually be find wander round in pack shout on saturday night in nondescript town centre then you will love this film and find it a right laff everyone else run dont walk away from this sorry little misfit and one question when the group leave the boring seaside town saltcoats incidentally although they change the name on the film to go back to glasgow why do they do it via the forton motorway service at lancaster which be in england  n  doctor mordrid be one of those rare film that be completely under the radar but be totally worthwhile it really remind me of the old serial from the s and s  which be why id have love to see followup movie     but judge by the rest of full moon output there simply werent enough tit to satisfy the typical audience unfortunately thank to a completely superfluous sacrifice scene there two too many for a family audience which be unfortunate because without em this could have be a harry potterstyle magicfest that kid would have eat up both jeffrey comb and yvette nipar be great i wasnt sure if ms  nipar hadnt wander off an alist picture onto this film she be very believable no seriously anyway it a shame they didnt have the buck to license dr  strange because i think this could have be a total kiddie phenom  n  a truly muddle incomprehensible mess most thing in the film look more or less like but then there be futuristic thing just throw in like the policeman ray gun and that car the director seem to be in love with colored light the only really notable performance be the girl who play valerie but since there be no cast listing i dont know which actress that be this one be worth miss grade f  n  it doesnt happen very often but occasionally one man can make a difference a big difference george criles best seller charlie wilson war be a fascinating and eyeopening account of the most unlikely difference maker imaginable a relatively obscure congressman from the second district of texas good time charlie be know more for his libertine lifestyle than his libertarian legislation likable and licentious even for a politician charlie wilson serve his constituency well since the good folk of lufkin only really want two thing their gun and to be leave alone it easy street replete with his bevy of beltway beauty know appropriately enough a charlies angels when ask why his entire office staff be compose of attractive young aide his response be a classic you can teach em to type but you cant teach em to grow tit no argument there but even the most rakish rapscallion have a conscience lurk somewhere underneath and for charlie wilson the unimaginable atrocity be commit in afghanistan move him to muster his entire political savvy toward fund the utter humiliate defeat of the russian military and possibly to even help hasten the end of the cold war a a result fat chance huh under the skillful direction of mike nichols and a smart snappy screenplay by adam sorkin charlie wilson war be a sparkling sophisticated satire that chronicle the behindthe scene machination of three colorful character comprise charlies team the onscreen team be compose of three marvelous actor with four academy award and nine nomination between them charlie be beautifully portray by tom hank in a solid slightly understated fashion that be among his best work in year he aid abet and abedded by joanne herring a wealthy houston socialite play by the stillslinky julia roberts hey why else have the bikini scene than to let the world know this by all account ms  robert look good and hold her own but the screenplay never give u even a hint why kabul and country be so important to her character maybe the two afghan hound usually by her side know but we a an audience never do a for the third member of the team philip seymour hoffman steal every scene he appear in a gust aurakotos a smart street wise i e non ivy league graduate cia malcontent who know the score both in the agency boardroom and in wilson bedroom for the mujahideen to succeed the most important assistance the u s  can provide be the ability to shoot down the dreaded mi helicopter gunships which rule the sky this take money lot of money and eventually charlies team covertly coerces those in congress to fund the effort to the tune of billion dollar for advanced weaponry to arm the afghan rebel this include topoftheline stateoftheart antiaircraft and antitank rocket as well a other highly sophisticated kill device nasty nasty stuff that this kind of multibillion dollar illicit activity can and do take place behind congressional door be truly alarming every american should see this movie or read this book because it reveal a truly frightening aspect of the businessasusual political scene rarely see outside the wall of our very own government oh momma i wish it werent so     even though the initial outcome for team charlie be an unqualified success the unimaginable unanticipated final result be that these sophisticated weapon be now use against our troop by the taliban and others since the funding be entirely covert the young generation in this part of the world have no idea the fall of soviet oppression and the end to russian barbarity be the direct result of american intervention yes once the russkies leave so do our aid zip for school zip for infrastructure zip on maintain meaningful relationship with the afghan people a a result the overall consequence be an unmitigated disaster it like the forerunner to mission accomplished as nichols film so pointedly point out the ball youve set in motion can keep bounce even after youve lose interest in it mike krzyzewski know this eva longoria parker know this little lateesha in lafayette know this but the typical american politician doesnt so we go from good guy to bad guy because we couldnt let the world know we be the good guy talk about a catch another mike nichols film  perhaps charlie wilson say it best we f ked up the end game again  n  im a big fan of surrealist art but this film by bunuel with some idea from dali leave me cold bunuel have a lifelong grudge against the catholic church and delight in try to offend catholic in fairly silly way this be one of the silly almost like what youd expect from a smartaleck yearold in film class the last few minute of the movie which have nothing to do with anything else be a final nosethumbing at religion if you read the scholar regard this slowpaced occasionally amusing film it all about how the church and society be guilty of sexual repression if that be indeed the point then bunuel express it in the most roundabout fashion possible the central male character be a nasty ute who love kick dog and knock blind men down in the street and who mentally turn billboard ad into strange sexual fantasy be this behavior the church fault for interrupt his lovemaking or be he just a jerk i vote for the latter i think bunuel must have have a lot of personal hangups and choose the catholic a the one to blame there be a few moment where you might cry aha surrealism a cow in a bed a giraffe fall out a window a poor model a man shred a feather pillow a woman flush a toilet while we watch picture of seethe lava or a mud pit     hard to tell in b w the rest be forgettable selfindulgence unfortunately bunuel be still chase the same bogeyman through the rest of his career viridiana discreet charm     if youre interested in see surrealism on the screen check out jean cocteau early work  n  this ludicrous film offer the standard s hippie mentality in a nut shell and bore u in the process it an attempt to rationalize absurd marriage of young innocent woman with old age sex fiend and wash ups a naive young hippy play by the waiflike kay lenz hitch hike and sleep with all the wrong guy and then one day she meet the ridiculous holden already in old age hard liquor drinking and wash up a an actor and she decide that she be in love with him if you think that be superficial the whole film encapsulates such scene she keep say how much she love him and she only meet him it wear thin and really quick i couldnt help but laugh throughout the film it obvious shes just use him a a meal ticket but the director be immature enough to think we be go to buy that there be actually any love take place a disgusting scene be where the two be naked and have sex i have to fast forward it because it almost inspire me to vomit a corny offering of music from the s be also spread through the film avoid this if you can grade d  n  this film be pretty good i be not too big a fan of baseball but this be a movie that be make to help understand the meaning of love determination heart etc danny glover joseph gordonlevitt brenda fricker christopher lloyd tony danza and milton davis jr  be ought in with a variety of talented actor and understanding of the sport the plot be believable and i love the message william dear and the guy put together a great movie most sport film revolve around true story or event and they often do not work well but this film hit a on the perfectness scale even though there be a few minor mistake here and there    n  for his first ever debut this film have some riveting and chill moment in the best horror film fashion the pit of your stomach tighten every moment during this film the end be superb the maker of blaire witch obviously watch this film it end wasnt an end but a beginning of the end a great movie and only a piece of japan great as far a scare factor a perfect score it make you think and scar out of your mind  n  this film contain far too much meaningless violence too much shooting and blood the act seem very unrealistic and be generally poor the only reason to see this film be if you like very old car  n  pathetic attempt to use science to justify new age religion philosophy the two have nothing to do with each other and much of what be say about quantum physic in this mess be just plain wrong examples quantum theory support the idea in eastern religion that reality be an illusion how well in the world of the subatomic you can never definitely predict a particle location at a specific time you can only give the odds of it be precisely at one spot at one time also the act of observation seem to affect the event solid particle can pass through barrier all of this so far be accurate but then they assert that that mean that if you believe sincerely enough that you could walk through a wall you could indeed do it this be complete poppycock instead the theory assert that at our level it be possible for you to walk through a wall but it be merely by chance and have nothing to do with belief also youd have to keep walk into the wall for eternity to ever have even the remote chance of pass through the wall the odds be so astronomically against it this be but one example of how they misrepresent the science but much more annoying be the narrative involve an unhappy photographer play by marlee maitlan about halfway through the picture it become so confused a to be incomprehensible something to do with negative thought lead to addiction and selfhate there may be some truth to that but quantum physic have nothing to do with it plus string theory be the hot new thing in physic nowadays instead of waste your time with this dreck i suggest you rent the elegant universe an amazing series do for nova on pb that give you a history of physic from newton and gravity to ed witten and m theory in only hourlong episode quantum mechanic be explain there quite well if you want to know it without the fog of metaphysical appropriation  n  i be truly look forward to this title it sound and look fun the idea of someone make a cheesy s monster movie could have be worth a few laugh but instead this title only bore first off there be almost no froggg in the entire movie which be the big disappointment i have to sit through minute of lame drama and dialog to get a few glimpse of the froggg hump a bare easted chick why on top of that the film lack any sort of fun plot i mean give me something thats a bit more interesting than just a bunch of talk head i want to see some hot chick search for the creature in the swamp i want to see some cuties drag off to his lair in desperate need of rescue creature from the black lagoon stuff i want to see a few goofy action scene of the froggg go on a killing spree or it maybe escape a silly trap something excite geez have fun with it be creative who want to sit through endless and tire dialog scene in a creature flick my advice to the filmmaker keep go your concept be good but your execution need to be a lot more inspire have some fun with the creature put the humor in the action and most important     put more creature in a creature movie  n  one of my sister friends lent me this game and it be too damn hard it carry the appearance of a kid game but you have to learn how to do ton of intricate move that require you to twist and turn your hand into all sort of awkward position and you have to search seemingly endless level for note to improve your score you also have to find these impossibly hide jigsaw puzzle piece that require you to do almost impossible task to get them and i be only up to stage three maybe if you have no life nad can stay home all the time you might get some enjoyment out of this but otherwise keep away and it be definately not recommend for kid they will pull their hair out within the hour  n  chuck jones rabbit season the second in the much beloved hunt trilogy be often consider to be the best of the three while i find it almost impossible to choose between this trio of fantastic cartoon i would have to concede that rabbit seasoning be the most finely honed script here the emphasis be place on language a bug and daffy run through a series of complex dialogue in the grand tradition of abbot and costellos who on next routine a a long term daffy fan i have always be delight by the hunting trilogy because it be consistently daffy who get all the best line the famous pronoun trouble be one of the all time classic and do most of the work bug play the role of cool manipulator while elmer a always be the befuddled dupe part of what make the hunt trilogy so much fun be that daffy and elmer pose so little threat to bug that he be basically just kick back and have some easy laugh elmer fall into every trap that be lay for him but it be poor old daffy who come off bad be shoot in the face again and again his beak end up in more and more ridiculous position it all build to the inevitable climactic declaration youre despicable a intricate an example of chuck jones impeccable timing a youll come across rabbit seasoning be a true classic  n  a lovely little b picture with all the usual joe lewis touch     people rip up pillow and aura of lurk fear also alas an end that come out of nowhere because apparently the auteur have lose interest in the movie or perhaps because a a b picture it have to fit into a slot  n  crossfire be a justifiably famous noir

joseph samuel sam levene be someone the soldier meet in a bar they go up to his apartment to continue their visit and samuel wind up dead i dont know about but see crossfire today one know who do it and why the minute we see the suspect i dont suppose it be so apparent back then a these actor be just get start nevertheless the film pack a big punch with it powerful acting good direction violence and unsparing antisemite language the characterization be vivid include that of gloria grahame in a smallish role shes a woman who meet mitchell george cooper one of the suspect soldier in a bar and can provide him with an alibi the big performance in the film belongs to robert ryan but everyone be excellent robert young especially be effective a a tough but intelligent police detective mitchum be very likable a a soldier try to help his confused friend mitchell a lonely man unsure if he still have feeling for his wife truly excellent and a must see  n  awwww i just love this movie to bits

champ of it time this be not a bond game base on material from another medium this be a completely new script game which even have it own theme song wouldnt be bond without it haha gameplay be excellent and if youre a fan of the bond game or film alike youll enjoy it unlike some most game these cast member portray their character themselves a oppose to fictional creation for the game which give it that more cinematic feel with a very bondable storyline you feel like youre in the game as much a you get lose in a movie enjoyable in all aspect from start to finish even after beat the game

good game that you can pick up play whenever you feel the need to get a little more bond in your life even now just think about it ive get the theme song stuck in my head such a great cast and

immobile in a wheelchair but still ings across her traditional intensity kenneth branagh be tolerable the movie itself be good not exceptional if you be a helena bonham carter fan it be worth see  n  i comment on this when it first debut and give it a thumb in the middle review remark that id give it the benefit of the doubt beyond just the first episode ive see a total of six episode now up to this point in june and a a lifelong batman fanatic i can say without hesitation this show be utter crap everythings wrong with it everything get past just the lousy animation and design the story be ridiculously convolute and with no character development or apparent interest by the writer of this dreck to give any substance to any stories and for god sake     be it just me or be the joker in every episode be gotham that much of a revolvingdoor justice system or again be it just a complete lack of interest in the writer to put any effort into other villain see no character development above  and to make matter bad every single joker tale be the same part formula joker gas people joker set out to gas the whole city batman save the day pfeh there be one episode i saw that wasnt a joker story the title escape me but the villain be that nefarious cluemaster     the think thank thunk episode with the quiz show that be the singleworst batman story ive ever see heard or read yes bad than ive get batman in my basement i cant really say what i feel this show be because it probably against the tos but it start with b and rhyme with fastardization thank goodness for the existence of the timm dini etc era of batentertainment back from the fox and kid wb day stuff that good and i should have know this just couldnt possibly have last forever unfortunately  n  just because someone be under the age of do not mean they be stupid if your child like this film youd well have him her test i be continually amaze at how so many people can be involve in something that turn out so bad this film be a showcase for digital wizardry and nothing else the writing be horrid i cant remember when ive heard such bad dialogue the song be beyond wretched the acting be subpar but then the actor be not give much who decide to employ joey fatone he can not sing and he be ugly a sin the bad thing be the obviousness of it all it be a if the writer go out of their way to make it all as stupid a possible great childrens movie be wicked smart and full of wit film like shrek and toy story in recent year willie wonka and the witch to mention two of the past but in the continual dumbingdown of american more be flock to dreck like find nemo yes thats right the recent charlie the chocolate factory and eyecrossing trash like red riding hood  n  hey babu riba be a film about a young woman mariana nickname esther after a famous american movie star and four young men glenn sacha kicha and pop all perhaps year old in belgrade yugoslavia the five be commit friend and crazy about jazz blue jean or anything american it seems the very close relationship of the teenager be poignant and ultimately a sacrifice be willingly make to try to help one of the group who have fall on unexpected difficulty in the wake of change communist politics they go their separate way and reunite in the year before the film be make  i enjoy the film with some reservation the subtitle for one thing be difficult especially in the beginning there be a number of dialogue which have no subtitle at all perhaps the conversational pace require it but i couldnt always both read the text and absorb the scene which cause me to not always understand which character be involve i watch the movie a video from our public liary with a friend and neither of u really understood part of the story about acquire streptomycin for a sick relative this yugoslavian come of age film effectively convey the teenager sense of invulnerability idealism and strong and loyal bond to each other there be a main flashforward and it be intrigue keep me guess until the end a to who these character be visavis the cast and what have actually happened i would rate it out of and would like to see other film by the director jovan acin  n  after a snowstorm the road be block and the highway patrolman jason adam beach come to the diner of his friend fritz jurgen prochnow and advise his client that they will only be able to follow their trip on the next day among the weird stranger jason meet his former sweetheart nancy rise mcgowan who have just leave her husband in los angeles along the night without any communication with his base jason face distressful and suspicious situation with the client and find some corps indicate that among them there be a killer the last stop could be an average thriller but the screenplay be simply awful most of the character be despicable person and the motif of the surprising serial killer be never disclose and the viewer have no further explanation why the killer decide to kill the guest my vote be four title brazil encurralados trap  n  this movie be a fairly entertaining comedy about murphy law be apply to home ownership and construction if a film like this be be make today no doubt the family would be dysfunctional since it be set in the simpler forties we get what be suppose to be a typical family of the era grant of course perfectly blend the comedic and dramatic element and he work with a more than competent support cast highlight by loy and douglas their shenanigan make for a solid ninety minute of entertainment  n  what can you say about the film white fire amazing fantastic disturb hilarious these word be not big enough to describe the event which be white fire from wobbly garble beginning to profound end this movie will entertain throughout our movie begin in the wood of a country somewhere in the world a family be hide from unmarked soldier in costume shop uniform when the father separate from the mother and their childen you get a real sense of what kind of movie youre about to watch father make sure to roll down hill in his all white outfit and be polite a he get people attention before he shoot them but alas dad be burn alive in what look like a very unsupervised unsafe stunt meanwhile mom and the kid be run down a beach with an arm soldier trail about foot behind them he too give a stern warning before action in the form of a bizarre halt and then promptly waste the mother this action sequence set up the happy childhood of our hero bo and ingred so now we fast forward about year if youre honest about the hero age to beautiful turkey where bo and ingred have settle a professional thief or diamond prospector or something ingred work at a diamond mine where she help herself to the good while bo masterfully play by the dynamic robert ginty drive around the desert in his denim outfit bo and ingrid have an interesting relationship they dont seem to have any friend other than each other and they spend all of their time together that couple with the fact that bo have express his desire to sleep with his sister a evidence in line such a you know it a shame youre my sister he say to her while shes stark naked make for a very dynamic duo bo be then crush when ingrid be kill a he wander the beach of turkey with his ceremonial pink grief scarf a renewal of hope occurs when bo find a girl who look like ingrid and give her plastic surgery to make her look exactly like ingrid this open the door for bo to have sex with his sister without it be technically wrong bo be a real fan of ethical grey area and he be overjoy with his new love so anyway theres a lot of fun action scene ridiculous violence great act impossible to follow plotlines fred the hammer williamson for some reason and a big chunk of dirty ice which be suppose to be a giant diamond which later explode all of these thing be great but the bo and ingrid relationship be what make this movie special      really special so i heartily encourage everyone to behold the majesty that be white fire you may be glad you did  or not  n  i be so disappointed this movie leave me feel jipped out of my time and mental energy here be the quintessential woody allen film all over again the neurotic upperclass manhattanites debate whether or not they will cheat on their spouse woody ive see these character already ive see the storyline from you ten time already where do your creativity go you need to open your eye and look around you the world have change dramatically since annie hall and you need to change along with it there be far more interesting and funny scenario to which you can apply your and of angst and neuroticism why not try them out instead of rehash the same old slop over and over and over again when i hear that woody allen have a new project come out it do nothing for me because now ive come to expect his old standby the couple who be grow tire of each other and end up cheat depressing and same old same old if woody want to win his fan back then he have to understand that our sense of humor and intelligence have to be stimulate not insult  n  this movie be all ultralightweight fluff predictable from begin to end a a don knotts vehicle the incredible mr  limpet be much good with knotts character there not nearly a incompetent or ignorant his performance there be tone down with none of his trademark goggleeyed stare although that may have something to do with him be replace for most of the movie by a cartoon fish knotts make a living of play the likable imbecile much a bob denver do neither really seem to be able to eak out to other type of role assume they be simply typecast it be probably because of the slouch the wild stare and the highpitched voice john ritter whom knotts work with in three company be able to transcend his genre anching out successfully into dramatic role like the dreamer of oz but the close knotts ever get be a small role in pleasantville even leslie nielsen be a bad fit here uncomfortably neither straight dramatic actor a he be at the time nor deadpan comedic actor a he later become in airplane and police squad theres also no way the then yearold knotts could pass for a yearold a his character insist he be it be a ludicrously unbelievable a tom hank at play the collegeage forrest gump the film be clearly make on a shoestring budget very much look like a hastilyfilmed tv episode it especially evident in the exterior scene of the town where roy go after he fire it unlikely even a preschooler would be fool by the mayberrylike soundstage artificiality even view this strictly a a childrens movie it very disappoint it not because it lack action or special effect although it do the pace be much too slow the situation repetitive how many time can you watch roy get onto a bus a comedy for kid should at least sometimes be madcap with eakneck gag otherwise you risk bore them and any adult in the theater as well movie even kid movie have improve quite a bit in the intervening decade even many contemporary comedy be good film and write disneys the love bug for instance at least have some interesting race action  n  if you be interested in learn more about this sort of thing happen in modern civilization there be an excellent book call outlaw sea or the outlaw sea and it describe in story after story how these thing do happen the lawlessness of the high sea be a reality for a number of reason one many of the world freighter be of questionable registry nationality and it difficult to impossible to enforce international law when the ship owner dont have an office in a real country two many ship line employ crew from dirt poor third world country the crew be often like illegal immigrant worker threaten and bully into comply with questionable or illegal practice three there be often a language barrier not only between the officer and the crew but also between the crew member themselves the crew be reward for their compliance and their silence four once commit an illegal act the ship be able to hide in plain sight with little more than a fresh coat of paint anyway it fascinate reading horrifying story excellent movie do anyone else notice how hbo seem to make the best and most important movie hollywood have trouble release enough oscar worthy movie in any give year so that several of the top contender usually come from britain jerry bruckheimer the end of quality cinema i love the thoroughly evil performance by sean pertwee i also as usual love omar epps  n  gamers dr be not a fancy make movie it more like amateur video horrible magic effect really fake fireball terribly make dungeon castle village         sword axe shield robe plate        okok     everything you will need about minute to adjust your expect on visual then you will get minute of fun im from hongkong and it really hard to find rpers none of my friend play rpg and i always fancy to be one of the character in the world of d d watch gamers dr just show me what would it be like to be a gamer you see rule book dice game set etc etc etc you hear term like fighter wizard hit point level character flame hand chaotic evil what rpg fancy me be that it let you do anything u want to not bond by software rpg gamers dr provide the same element you wont know what happen next and it probably just make you laugh to dead the movie go both gamerss real life as well a in the d d world you will hear the gamer cast the dice when the character in game take action which make you feel you really participle in the game i dont want to spoil anything but in short gamers dr be a must watch movie for rpg lover for people never play rpg game im sure you still get many fun from it  n  in all honesty i havent see this film for many year but the few time i have tend to make part of it stick in my memory a anyone who have see it will understand i first saw it a a child at a ymca halloween party in the early sixty and it scar the hell out of u kid in a fun way i remember feel genuine anxiety about the unknown thing lurking in the maze i cant risk give away the end except to say that it be surprise to say the least i remember vaguely the entire audience of young boy let out a big scar holler follow by laughter when the terrible secret be reveal the end have be see by most viewer a one of the great unintentionally funny climax to a movie in film history and yet oddly move in a way you have to see it for yourself which be not easy these day i dont know if it available on home video or not but it would still make a great halloween feature for both kid and adult  n  this be the only thing i will be able to look back on from the year and say now that rock it rock hard and yet it also rock tasty mr meatloaf add a nice little touch to this dish of a film before the opening credit even roll now that tell you something this film rock even before it start now i dont want to give to much away or be a spoiler but this movie rock if you have hear the new album and think to yourself this seem a bit substandard tenacious materialit be like i a merely play badminton with satan what give then this movie will elevate your appreciation for the music and you will marvel at this steamy satanic masterpiece for those who would want it good do not know what they wantbecause good would no longer be the d  this movie be the d period so venture if you dare to the local viewing theater if you to want to have your sock rock  n  youd think youre in for some serious sightseeing when the premise of the movie take place primarily between two character a they travel mile or so from france to saudi arabia go through most of europe italy bulgaria croatia slovenia turkey before arrive in the middle east but this be not a tour and there be no stopover for soak in the sights redas father be in his twilight year and wish to do the haj however since walking and take the mule be out of the question he choose to travel to mecca by car he cant drive and therefore enlist the help of reda to his son protest to get him there in their oken down vehicle but reda doesnt see the point of have him go along when his dad could opt for the plane he resent the idea of have put his personal life on hold for this pilgrimage he couldnt understand and hence we set off in this arduous journey with father and son be not the best of pals the beauty of this movie be to witness the development of the father and son pair the challenge they face the weird people they meet have to duke it out in varied weather condition and alternate rest stop between motel and sleep in the car we see an obvious generation gap in them try to communicate to each other the father try to impose on his son and the son try to assert himself a an adult but circumstance we see reveal that reda be quite a fish out of water through the many encounter they actually team up quite well despite their differences its perhaps quite apt to have this film release here last week to coincide with hari raya haji and have the opportunity to watch our protagonist join the other pilgrim in their haj the final scene in mecca be truly a sight to behold and you too would feel the claustrophobia and fear a reda try to hunt down his dad amongst the thousand of people congregate the sight of europe be perhaps deliberately not dwell upon so a to build up the anticipation of and focus on the final destination it certainly ring home the thought of tell and show love one how much you appreciate them for who they be dont miss this and yes book early i be pleasantly surprise that this evening session be still a full house  n  i watch this movie base on the good review here and i wont make that mistake again the first couple minute show that a group of people have be ought together by some tragedy but you dont see what it be flashback hour and we get to see the boring life of each of these people which in the end be totally meaningless to what be about to happen when the end be finally revel you realize that you just waste an hour of your life wait for a big payoff that doesnt happen and mean nothing to what you have be watch the only connection these people have be that they have all have a bad daybut even that continuity get lose in the boredom if this be suppose to be a crash clone it a complete failure  n  a great bug bunny cartoon from the early year have bug a a performer in an window display at a local department store after he do for the day the manager come in to tell him that hell be transfer soon bug be happy to oblige into he figure out that the new job be in taxidermy     and that taxidermy have to do with stuff animal animal like say a certain rabbit this cause a battle of wit between the rascally rabbit and his now former employer i find this short to be delightful and definitely one of the good one of the early s  it still remain a funny nearly year later this animate short can be see on disc of the looney tune golden collection volume  my grade a  n  i firmly believe that the best oscar ceremony in recent year be in for two reason host steve martin be at his most witty i saw the teamster help michael moore into the trunk of his limo and ill good not mention the gay mafia in case i wake up with a poodle head in my bed surprise winners no one have adrien brody down for best actor genuine applause or roman polanski for best director genuine jeer and boo but they win last year award ceremony wasnt too bad but there be little in the way of surprise and i be happy to see return of the king sweep the award even if it wasnt the best in the trilogy fellowship be much good but what let the bbc coverage down be jonathan ross get a few of his sycophantic mate round and pretend they be hilarious when they be anything but so when i hear sky be do the coverage for british tv i be expect barry norman and mark kermode to be do the link but instead we end up with jamie theakston and sharon osbourne oh gawd if british tv be desperate for film critic obviously they be im sure both bob the moo and theo robertson will happily fly over to la to give their honest opinion on the winner and loser chris rock wasnt too bad but hes no steve martin while the location seem to resemble a sport hall with seat put in not much of a glitzy arena in my opinion the main problem i have with the ceremony be the format with the minor oscar hand out to the winner who be sit in their seat theres no such thing a a minor oscar and just because the award be for best animate short or best costume design theyre a well deserve a best picture or best director all the winner should be allow to march up to the podium what a bunch of arrogant snob the academy be become and i quite agree with the comment that this format be disgraceful and if it wasnt for the surprise this could possibly have be the bad ceremony in history a for the award themselves best support actress cate blanchett no great surprise for a competitive category best support actor morgan freeman no real complaint since freeman be one of america great living character actor best actor jamie foxx most predictable award of the night yawn best actress hilary swank major surprise since everyone think annette benning be go to win simply down to academy politics but swank do deserve it and give the best speech of the night best director clint eastwood major surprise since everyone think scorsese be go to get the award simply because hed never win one actually im glad about this because if he didnt deserve it for taxi driver rag bull or goodfellas he didnt deserve it for the aviator best film million dollar baby again another major surprise since everyone think the academy would split the award for best director and best picture while i think the hollywood friendly plot of the aviator would have make it a dead cert for best picture while mdbs controversial subject matter would have turn a lot of voter off what these award perhaps illustrate be that this year the voter have decide to ignore oscar politics and genuinely give out award to people who deserve it something they havent do in the past i mean a beautiful mind beat the fellowship of the ring for gawds sake and long may the academy vote with their head instead of their heart  n  while in a plane flick through the large choice of movie i come across live almost accidentally oh boy what a choice i remember vaguely see the trailer over a year ago and completely forget about it expect no more than another cheesy nonsense movie about a stupid reality show now i can easily say this have be a hell of a ride i dont remember last time i have be so excited terrify not sure if it be the high altitude play with my sens but the suspense grow gradually through the movie until reach a climax where you cant turn away from the screen literally sit on the edge of your seat and bite the remain nail youve got you will first go through a personal moral assessment of where you stand about the righteousness of the show you will drift from think how come the human be can be so vicious to why not after all  ask yourself would you do it then learn about the contestant their motif and start guess you will then watch contestant pull the trigger one by one and get excite even though you know the first candidate be safe good act good directing with a movie experience that remind you those old movie where you know what would happen in the next scene but still be crave for more  spoilers  couple of thing i would have change the casting of the contestant i have really be move by the farmer and we should have have a bit more like him the idea of a rich writer who want to be famous be a bit stupid it felt like you didnt care about some of the contestant although this might have be do on purpose i think the audience should have be able to associate with the majority of the contestant game rule a big glitch what happen if the th contestant doesnt die when he pull the trigger do you seriously think the last standing guy will pull the trigger and execute himself they should have give a chance to all contestant to live ie if th be a blank too then no one dies interestingly i havent be bother too much by this bad point cause i really have a good time just wish i have some popcorn with me  n  ah another movie with motorcycle hell angel posse and steve alameo a the notsocool car driver this movie do not rely on story but lot of drinking pot smoking and lot of moronic act steves rendition of a die cat during his i love what i know serenade have me vomit for hour bike chick linda rrrr make out with everyone fat do the best acting since he just grunt and make sound i also dare you to try to make out what banjo be say you messin wit private stock this be scriptwriting folks i like the end what good place to have the climax than a lighthouse you have to see this to detest it die jeter die  n  a rating of do not begin to express how dull depressing and relentlessly bad this movie be  n  i feel dumber after watch the first minluckily i walk out and save the rest of my ain people should watch good film and take note on why they be rat highlynot because of the budget of the film or the special effect just simply good acting and get simple thing rightand most importantlynot be lame but i guess this be produce for those sheeple without taste and not a clue of what be a good moviedont be scar of rating film lowsave your underappreciated high score for once in a life time movie keep in mind that many use imdb for trusted review and opinionsdont spoil the oth by sugarcoat turd peace love  n  the most selfindulgent movie i have every have the misfortune torent unwatchable much of the movie be obviously improvisedand not well it look like toback take the first take ofeverything the movie get good for a couple of minute whenrobert downey jr  show up then go to hell again realquickly  n  this have get to be the bad movie i haver ever see nielson in this movie just do not have what he need to be funny i think the reason that the naked gun and the like movie be that they do not require nielson to be funny he just play the role as straight a he could while all of the comedy that go on be mostly visual but when you put him in a movie where he have to be funny he isnt the movie have only one good part and this may be consider a spoiler by some and that the begin credit be animate if the whole movie have be animate it might have be good i have no intention of see this movie when i saw the ad for it and the only reason i do see it be because the ticket be give to me by someone who win them in a radio contest this be the first and probably only movie i have ever walk out on on a scale of i give this movie a score of  n  i like ghost story good ghost story of bump in the night voice that can not be explain now ive see many of them a special efx have a ever more grip on today film some time to find a real gem you get ta turn the clock back to the time when the writer and director really have to use their head to create really good ghost story now this one very rare pilot episode for the tv series ghost story call the new house be one of the most scary film i ever saw it be on once in     i be only   but nothing since then even compare to it with all the remake go on in hollywood some one should do this one a be with no more special efx than the original this episode be down right creepy a hell im lucky to find it finally on dvd today and very rare and hard to find the only other ghost story to even come close be the original the haunting and george c  scott in the changling wish someone would do more ghost story like these  n  okay ive watch this movie twice now i have research it heavily on the net i have ask several people on there opinion i have even go to the length of read the original sheridan lafanu classic carmilla a book that this movie be suppose to be base on i feel that the best way to review this movie be to describe a game to play whilst watch it a the plot of the movie doesnt seem to make any sense at all here be the plot of the book laura live in a castle in syberia with her father mr de lafontaine they carry on with their life blissfully and peacefully one day they get a letter from the general a man who have make it his mission in life to avenge his daughter death he make claim of supernatural power be at work and explain that he will visit them soon meanwhile a chance encounter with a strange woman result in the lafontaines look after her daughter carmilla for several month soon laura start to be overwhelm by strange dream and begin to come down with a strange illness who be this mysterious carmilla and just what have she to do with lauras condition and the general i have invent this game and would like a many people a possible to play it and let me know what their result be i even have a catchy name and would have a jingle too but i cant be bother with that it call the this movie doesnt make any sense game all you have to do be whilst watch the movie try to come up with a complete plot that explain what be happen i mean complete all question answer everything make sense absolutely complete it will have to answer such question a     why can vampires walk around in day light why be they all lesbian why be a girl call bob and why do she shoot herself when be the movie a dream and when be it real why do kill zombie appear to be an accepted part of life that doesnt make anyone bat an eyelid why do travis fontaine spot and run down a zombie without slow down whilst drive his car yet when face with a woman with an obvious hostage in the back of her car accept the excuse that she be a zombie too and why do he then let a girl which he later openly reveal that he know be the head vampire drive with him in his car and then let her drive off alone with his daughter in a stolen car what the hell be the asylum scene all about what the hell be the green goo all about why do the head vampire suddenly start dress like a nurse why be there never any vampire fight zombie what be the significance of the necklace what be it make of why do it kill vampire and how do jenna know that in fact sod it it just as much fun try to come up with as many question about this movie too i have my plot and i have to admit it be not quite there but it be a pretty good effort in conclusionvampires vs zombie have no moment in it where there be actually vampire fight zombie everyone in the movie seem to know exactly what be go on yet they seem very reluctant to let the audience in on this and somehow it be base on a classic th century horror novel how why what the hell be go on  n  this wouldve be a  great  silent film the act really be good at least in a look ma im do really big act sort of way everything be huge every line be profound every scene be shatter by human tragedy mostly i felt like gag yet like any train wreck i couldnt tear my eye away this dialogue mightve work on the stage although i doubt it on the screen it be clutter haphazard hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work if you enjoy your melodrama in huge heaping dos you  might  enjoy the movie be prepare to wait however for all that melodrama this thing sure plod along at it own pace this script mustve sound a lot different when the actor involve be read it to themselves it simply doesnt work once they get around to deliver it in front of the camera imdb do u a great disservice at time when it use it goofy computercontrolled weight score curse of the starve class deserve less than a  characterdriven fiction be great but when you develop your character by simply push them through hoop with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution it isnt character development your character must have a motivation be drunk for a while and wake up in a field be  not  character development thats a plot contrivance stay away from this movie or at the very least watch it mute perhaps youll get some amusement from all the armwaving the character do oh and word to the wise to prove that this be truly an artsy film you see james wood in all his dangly male lookatme imthefigurativeandliteralrepresentationofthenakedvulnerabilityof man glory dont say you werent warn  n  this movie start with the main character lie in a coma in a hospital ward attend by two orderly the unconscious main character be hear in a voice over say that the orderly be gay the orderly kiss i watch this in a dvd version and i have the suspicion that this be suppose to be funny    it say     comedy on the dvd case after all and it go on like that have i see this in a movie theater i probably would have hear part of the audience roar with laughter because it be so funny    and because they be suppose to sit in a comedy while it be fascinate to think about what it be funny and what isnt this movie unfortunately only deliver argument about what isnt brilliant ains can make anything funny people like ernst lubitsch billy wilder or mel brook have prove that fact but you have to know the     mechanic i suppose director and coscriptwriter dani levy do not bother about those mechanic he think that certain thing simply be funny the fact that two orderly be gay and kiss over a man in a coma for example do not get me wrong some people can make that funny dani levy cant not for me anyway the main problem i have with this movie be that i cant see a reason behind the way the main character behave i could not understand why the two others one an orthodox jew from west germany one a third class carbon copy of fast eddie felson from former east germany so strongly dislike each other they be both rather bland character their child be bore apart from the fact that they be sexually attract to each other well one be a lesbian now but raise the daughter she have with her cousin but even these incestuous relationship    if anything they be embarrass just come through a an excuse because the scriptwriter could not come up with anything better the acting be not bad udo semel i actually come to like quite a lot although he remind me more of ex chancellor helmut kohl a light version than of a venerable orthodox jew the direction in itself be not really bad either but maybe levy should stick to direct movie leave the scriptwriting to someone else now i heard he do a comedy about hitler oi vai  n  this story about three woman be a very sensitive study about muri    l charlotte van den eynde the young laura el dottermans who be about and martha frieda pittors the old who be the mother of muri    l they live together in the same building they have different expectation of life the vital laura want a child muri    l come from a village and want to change her life in brussels martha dream about her youth when she be a young girl in fact nothing happen in this movie so you wait for something for instance an accident which could dramatize this story a time go on you discover that the director doroth  e van den berghe only want to develop a psychological portrait of the three woman and nothing more this movie be disappointing because you expect the woman to learn from their experience which be not the case so one be leave with a feeling of emptiness  n  first and foremost i love the novel by ray bradbury it the kind of horror that get under your skin and stick with you later it be one of his best book with you know fahrenheit and dandelion wine i a just hop that this movie would be all right it have lot of chance with a great cast like jason robards and jonathn pryce and bradbury even write the script himself and on top of all that it have pam grier how could it fail there may be spoiler within first of all it be dumbed down much of the horror from the book be lose a bradbury must have be force to keep the violence to a minimum all the visuals from the book     go everything that make you squirm     gone and then theres the act like a lot of movie that disney throw out in the s the kid in this movie can not act and this bug me a lot neither of them look but or their strong friendship wasnt address it be more like they be acquaintaces youd think jason robards and jonathan pryce could pull this off in their role of mr  halloway and mr  dark but here it like they just dont care all they want to do be somehow pay off some mortgage or something this be far from be some of their best performance pam grier be fine a the witch but the charecter of the dust witch herself wasnt well pull off shes a lot less evil and doesnt have the presence a she do in the book and everything that be leave out of the book the ballon night chase the marking of jims house the real death of mr  dark what happen to mr  coogan on the merrygoround the fate of the lightening rod salesman the real death of the witch and oh so much more and the special effect be bad even for the s  the merrygoround of doom for one thing with the superimposed horse go around wasnt really creepy and that weird green mist that really have nothing to do with anything i could keep go about how this movie rip apart the original novel but it make blood boil dont see this movie but read the book it a classic of bradbury  n  this film be so old i never realize how young look ray milland look in i remember him play in a great film lose weekend ray play the role of michael stuart who be a very rich banker there be three girl in this picture who be not very happy about their father and mother separating and they find out their father be go to get marry to a young blonde who be a gold digger only look for a rich sugar daddy they hire a man to pose a a very rich count his name be count ariszted misha auer who be drink all the time and be penniless and give plenty of comic laugh throughout the picture deanna durbin penny craig surprise everyone when she be book in a police station and tell the chief of police that she be an opera star and then penny start sing with the most fantastic soprano voice i have every heard the entire police department and convict start applaud which be a very entertaining and enjoyable scene from this film this be deanna durbins first film debut and she become an instant success over night and go on to become a great movie star with universal studio after leave mgm  n  i have eagerly await the first screening of this film ever since it be give to me on dvd at christmas have reserve a special slot for it last night i sit down to watch it with my daughter age and a film study student with chocolate of course in eager anticipation we love jane austin after just the first two minute we know we be sink the shaky camera shot and angle general poor cinematography direction and wooden performance have already leave u feel flat and dissatisfied despondent we view on anne play by sally hawkins look oddly and with no particular purpose directly at the camera on several occasion eaking our hardwon fantasy of the moment and engage u directly in an almost ill find you stalk fashion poor rupert penryjones who play captain wentworth do his best with the script and direction bless him i hope they pay him well however a he be practically drown on one occasion by a huge wave which predictably eached the seawall drench him and his coactor they be nearly sweep out to sea health and safety would have have a field day poor rupert be leave spit out sea water in order to deliver his line presumably there be not enough money leave in the kitty for a reshoot of this scene anyone with any sense would have not attempt it on such a day in the first place other than mr  penryjones alice krige give the only convincing performance a lady russell but her effort be soon counterbalance by those of anthony head unconvincing portrayal of annoy sir walter elliott towards the longawaited end of the film captain wentworth appear to oddly grace anne with a visit every two second have take great pain to avoid her for the majority of the movie it be a if he have develop a memory impediment which cause him to forget his very reason for be in contrast anne run hyperventilate from pillar to post in search of the good captain who in the meantime have manage to call upon almost the entirety of bath we be tell in the course of only three or four minute without even have work up a sweat we experience none of anne charm cross the screen indeed we be leave wonder what charismatic captain wentworth have ever see in plain spineless opinionless anne and why someone anyone do not tell mean wing sir walter to just shut the heck up the crucial kiss normally our favourite girlie moment be painfully draw out a they move in closer anne keep opening and closing her mouth which have the effect on screen of make her look a if she be chew gum before lip finally meet eww the most enjoyable thing about last night be the chocolate and the half hour exchange of view between mother and daughter on just how bad the film have been what a pity to ruin such an enchanting and engage story film in some of england fine scenery sorry jane  n  if you like scifi monster and ancient legend then you will love this movie the special effect be by far the best i have see since juarassic park hit the big screen year ago while the acting may have be a little less than desirable the story line and effect adequately compensate for it i wish now i have see this at the movie on a theater screen instead of our inch big screen tv if you like nonstop action awesome visuals and taste for myth and lore      you have to see this movie  n  a rather silly little film you just may love although rather corny and clich   at time it nonetheless work and make for good clean fun five team be engage on a scavenger hunt and battle each other and their wit to win the all night contest just for the sheer joy know yours be the best team notable for several screen debut include david naughtons first film role after his dr  pepper be a pepper commercial and before his major hit american werewolf in london also feature paul ruebens in what i believe be his first pee wee hermanesquire roll a year before he become know for it and last but not least mr  spin city and alex keaton himself michael j  fox get his first film role here fan will remember stephen furst a flounder in animal house outside of that no name but all funny characters doubt it have ever make it to dvd but there be still probably some vhs copy float around and you might even catch on a late late show sometime if you do be worth your watch you may hate it but it may also become a quirky little movie you come to love  n  this be an ok adaptation of the eath take book of dan brown i cant say it be novel or very good but they make a movie that you can enjoy give the excellent story the result could have be well though the movie be pretty long but at the end i be feel like some thing be miss sound effect and sound track be very good acting be well do but the character development phase be very weak for people who didnt read the book thing may look happen too quickly from my point of view instead of try to put as much a stuff from the book they could have try to do the important scene more proper what make the book very good be all the puzzle like story combine with the excellent portrait of vatican you see neither of it in the movie too much rush and use the time not in a good way these be main problem of the movie so it be worth watch but could have be do well  n  i never fell asleep during a movie never this movie do the impossible while many people claim the superiority of japanese horror film over their american counterpart this movie be a lesson in over abundance a in the movie be minute too long it would have help if the movie have a little more movement in the plot and the camera work but instead all we get be awkward silence and a lot of slow movement the acting be absolutely terrible border on bad student film level while everyone struggle to adlib something call a script do these people even get any direction be they coax to be boring and dull either therory wouldnt surprise me what be even bad be the rather unscary makeup involve with the creature from the other side either way they all stink dont watch this film thats all i can say unless youre an insomniac  n  what can i say not as bad a many here have make it out to be the only reason i even watch this film that i have previously never heard of before be strictly for ian mcshane i be not disappoint in the least ian mcshane be absolutely illiant and ings an amazing subtlety to his role he always great to watch and for my money     an extremely underused actor as for the rest of the film     every other actor in the movie deliver strong solid performance these people certainly werent be pay huge amount of cash for their participation a this be a fairly low budget film but this do not mean that any of them mail their appearance in everyone be convince and compel with the part give to them i be even pleasantly surprise at adrian paul performance though i must admit i have only ever see him in the highlander television series before this movie the plot be well pace and the storyline intriguing and much like real life not everything end up tie in a nice neat little package for you at the end of the film anybody who expect a clearcut bythenumbers connect the dots conclusion or answer at the end of the movie     clearly wasnt watch the film closely enough this film be not go to tell you what the meaning of life be the idea be that after see the film you might go and discuss the unanswered question with your friend over a coffee i certainly did no car chase     no explosion     no bar room awl     sound pretty dull huh but the reality be that i be completely absorb by the film and it just a well write little piece with an interesting hook and solid character performance by all party involve        warning            if youre the kind of person who dislike movie that dangle an enormous question a the central engine of the story and then end the movie without answer that particular question directly     you might not enjoy this film  n  originally harp a a sequel to the slumber party massacre series this film fall flat on it face with a new title first off if you be go to include the word massacre in your film title you good deliver this one certainly do not there be no gore no on screen murder and no chainsaw a the box art would lead you to believe instead we get a paper thin overdone plot about a group of cheerleader who get strand in an abandon cabin on the way to a football game only to be off one by one again this film could have be ok if the gore quotient be up a bit why director especially those do directtovideo flick be afraid to show any gore be beyond me now i be not a huge fan of excessive gore but come on     why else would anyone rent a movie call cheerleader massacre besides that problem the film suffers from a shotonahomevideocamera cheapness it look cheap sound cheap and the actor arent all that good it try to throw u off track to who the killer may be but even that fail the end end up be a ridiculous mess folk if you run across this film walk away and go find the original slumber party massacre out of  n  a killer cannibal rapist be kill by a crazed cop on the scene of his late murder at his grave a cult have gather with plan to resurrect him by pee onto the grave this of course work and he awake rip the guy penis off and he be back into his old killing way with an all new zombie look the two cop one of who be go a little crazy about the scum of the city and have a drug problem be back on the case two of the original cult member also try to stop the killer by resurrect some other kind of dead thing think they have file they leave but out from the grave come a plastic baby doll that be use in the original resurrection sound a bit confusing really but no it just rubbish the acting be terrible and one of the cop be the same guy that play dr vincent van gore in the face of gore series and he be just as terrible a the annoy cop in this film the other cop just about struggle to get his terrible line out now im all for low budget cinema but this film be just terrible if it wasnt for the very easy on the eye lady and their nakedness i would probably have fall asleep there be a bit of gore but it never more than some animal gut place on the stomach of the victim the zombie makeup on the other hand look great and his foot long penis that he use to rape his victim with be kind of funny at time there be also a half decent scene where the killer fall in love with a sex doll the doll with the chipmunk voice be the stupid thing i have ever see in a film it be just a plastic toy on a fishing line the end be extremely bad you would expect the killer to put up much more of a fight than he do god know how they make enough money to make a sequel  n  day of heaven be one of the most painfully boring and pointless film i have ever see in no way shape or form would i recommend it to anyone     unless youre try to put your kid to sleep or god forbid give someone an aneurysm if i could go back in time and do one thing i would set fire to the reel before they be send to theater why day of heaven plot be simple but extremely vague long sequence devoid of dialogue compose much of the film the character be too shallow and ridiculously stupid to relate with the climax of the story do not touch you by this time your ain have work so hard to figure out the plot and the array of hidden metaphor that your ability to think be go the only thing work be your eye and unfortunately your ear who must listen to the sound of linda the little girl in the story who talk like a man i be now dumber for see this movie dont let it happen to you  n  in director walt disney and animator ub iwerks change the face of animation with the release of the very first installment of their silly symphony series the skeleton dance iwerks and disney have be collaborate together since the early s in disneys laughogram cartoon series however their friendship suffer a tremendous blow when iwerks accept an offer by a competitor to leave disney and start his own animation studio that be the birth of celeity production where iwerks continue develop his style and technique and where he create the character of flip the frog while his work keep the same high quality it wasnt really popular and by the studio be close later that year iwerks be hire by columbia picture and iwerks decide to return to his old skeleton for another dance this time in color s skeleton frolic be essentially a remake of the classic the skeleton dance the movie that borough him fame and fortune like that short film it be set on an abandon graveyard where at midnight the creature of the night come alive and begin to play the dead rise from their coffin ready for the show thats about to begin a a group of skeleton have form an orchestra and begin to play a happy tune now it not easy to be a musician made of just bone a some of the orchestra member have problem with their body part however the band manage to put a good show and another group of skeleton begin to dance a lovely couple of them face the same problem that trouble the orchestra it hard to dance with loose body part everything end at dawn and just when the sun be about to rise again the skeleton run towards their graves directed and animate by ub iwerks himself skeleton frolic follow faithfully the pattern set by the skeleton dance year before although with a crucial difference iwerks do the whole film in technicolor the ight tonality allow iwerks to create a more visually appeal film and also to use the many new technique he have be practice since leave disney create even well effect of depth and dynamism than those he conceive before it be certainly a more experimental film than the skeleton dance although sadly this doesnt mean it necessarily a good film for starter the film be practically identical to the one he do with disney with the only difference be the music more on that later and the color effect it look beautiful no doubt about it but it definitely feel kind of unoriginal after all however it be not the unoriginality of the concept what truly hurt the film after all iwerks execute it in a wonderful way but the fact that the musical melody create by joe denat for the film be pretty uninteresting and lack the charming elegance and whimsical fun of the one do by carl w  stall for the skeleton dance in other word while denats tune be effective and appropriate for the theme it easy to forget about it rapidly while stalling song have a unique personality that make it unforgettable be a musical film this be of high importance and so the mediocrity of the music ings down iwerks flawless work of animation personally i think that with a good musical accompaniment skeleton frolic would be remember as fondly a the skeleton dance despite not be as groundeaking a it still a fun film to watch its kind of sad that most of the work iwerks do after leave disney be now forget due to his poor success however it must be say that if iwerks lack the popularity of disney or fleischer disney main rival he do not lack the quality of those company film it be probably just a case of bad luck what make the man who give life to disneys mouse for the first time to face failure out of disney despite it shortcoming skeleton frolic be a very funny and visually eathtaking film that while not exactly the most original and fresh film one just cant help but thinking of the skeleton dance while watch it it definitely remind u that iwerks skeleton be still here to haunt u and inspire us    n  yes indeed it could have be a good movie a love biangle sorry for the poetical license but be not a triangle an interesting story unfortunately badly tell the image be sometimes weird sometimes ok the picture look crowd and narrowsighted the sound need more attention it usually do in romanian movie the light and color filter be sometimes badly choose the soundtrack be short and be not help the action about the acting     sorry but the best actress be the landlady the others be act immaturely and can not convince the viewer the acting be poetical when it should be realistic and realistic when it should be poetical it a picture for adult tell by the child bother only if extremely curious  n  you wear only the best italian suit from armani hand stitch and fit to your exact measurement your automobile be the fine that german engineering have to offer and be equip with as many gadget a horse under the hood youre a member of the fine polo club frequently dine at restaurant such a spago and be always accompany by at least two of the most beautiful woman in the world your pocket watch double a a nuclear explosive while your trusty pen can also be use a a semiautomatic caliber gun you snow ski in the alp go deep sea diving in the caribbean sky dive over the andes and all the while your hair be never ever out of place you be bond james bond the world most renown spy favorite son of the good queen bad boy of the british s and perhaps the most desired man in the world the character of james bond be create by ian fleming and be the movie industry long last icon be the subject of over fifteen film span over four decade the late man to play the role be pierce brosnan who take over the role of james bond from timothy dalton in and make his debut in goldeneye this be the setting for the first major title develop by a third party on the nintendo goldeneye develop by rare for nintendo have be on the market for some time it continued dominance in the sale chart be just one testament to how good this game be and no review liary would be complete without it lets face it most of the time movielicensed game be flop although the two seem like a good mix the result for the most part have be horrendous game like cliffhanger true lie lethal weapon and not to mention all the star trek flop be ammunition enough against this mix and for the record i be not a fan of movie license game especially if ive see the movie at least thats how i use to think in the case of goldeneye i have more reservation than normal while not a bad movie goldeneye the film didnt have that much appeal to it and i dont rank it in the top ten amongst bond movie a a game however let just say it a completely different story the game be a firstperson shooter and in order to be successful youll need at least as much ains a awn for those who have see the movie which i imagine be most of you read this the story be very consistent and follow the path of the movie with little variation a plot to control the world most dangerous satellite goldeneye have begin in the ussr and in the process a beautiful woman have be capture your mission will be many the danger extreme you will have to rely on your wit and experience to get you through the most grueling mission the world have ever know m will ief you as soon a youre ready good day james  n  this be an excellent film about the character in a adult swim class their problem relationship and interaction with each other it should have manage a wide distribution a it much good than similar film from major studio out at the same time the swimming instructor be an almostolympian reduce to teach adult basic lesson and often the target of horndogging from his female student he attempt more or less to fend them off with vary results the student character be mainstream u s a teacher policeman college student and retired people all of whom havent learn to swim for some reason the movie cover their relationship include friend relative and romantic conquest a they go through the class several subplots provide amuse fodder include a teacher go through a divorce some high school student make a documentary and a girl who be only in the class to meet guys this be a good date movie or just one to watch when youre in the mood for a romantic drama with overtone of reality  n  this mostly routine factbased tv drama get a boost from the fine performance by cole this be the story of a highly trained military man unhappy with his wife and child fake his demise and run off with the other woman to support her in the manner in which she be accustom he robs bank predictable but not a bad watch  n  i watch six of a kind for w c  field hes only in it for around minute and have one long scene the infamous pool sequence he make famous in vaudeville and several other great moment the reamaining minute be also delightful thankfully mostly due to the hilarious charlie ruggles a the bumbling banker j  pinkham whinney he be everyones foil he stutter and stumble about to our pleasure also his comedy partner mary boland play his wife flora join in the proceeding be george burn and gracie allen boland be particularly funny near the beginning and near the end but gracie and ruggles use up most of the picture gracies funny quite but she can also get tire and poor george burn have absolutely nothing to do except repeat gracie all the time i dont remember laugh at him once although he have one great scene with ruggles where ruggles try desperately to get george to take gracie and leave him and his wife alone for a while and one with field where he ask field to sell him a sweater that bit be exclusively field though the situation be constantly funny the whinneys be go to drive to california but to help them with expense george and gracie be recruit  n  edmund lowe who remind me somewhat of warren william head the nice cast of an interesting little mystery that move at a isk pace and run just a little over an hour douglas walton play the unlucky jockey who appear to be intent on his own demise hypnotism anyone and the suspect include a good number of the support casteveryone from virginia bruce kent smith frieda inescourt gene lockhart jessie ralph benita hume rosalind ivan and h b warner a an added bonus there nat pendleton a a dimwit detectiveand furthermore get a load of that art deco set decoration for the fancy interior of a wealthy home must have be a set that be use in many a subsequent film on the plus side the mystery be not so complicate that anyone can follow the plot with reasonable assurance of not be too baffle it all suddenly clear to detective philo vanceand then he have a final confrontation with the murderer that give the film a nifty five minute of unmitigated suspense nicely do and pass the time in an entertaining manner  n  this movie be lame and not funny at all the plot doesnt even make sense some scientist who work on the fringe of science open a doorway to another dimension maybe hell and his daughter get suck through it or something then one day for no apparent reason she come back and now she have big east and wear a skimpy outfit i guess the demon in the other dimension make it for her the main character be a guy who want to marry his girlfriend but she be gay so obviously shes more interested in her new girlfriend and they stumble upon this witch spell book they want to be witch or something and the evil spell end up get read again which be how the evil demon come to earth which only the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently there be topless scene for no reason and a guy in it who my boyfriend say be a well know wrestler but his part be completely unnecessary obviously they make something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestle fan will actually watch this pointless movie im sure the topless girl doesnt hurt there either the extra feature on the dvd be even more confusing than the rest of the movie i think it might help explain what be go on but it actually just make thing more confusing who be these people and what be they do basically this be a gocampingtomakeoutthenfightamonster movie but there be a bunch of thing like the other dimension and book seller than make it confuse i didnt like the movie but it be only like five buck so big deal i dont recommend watch it though it be just too stupid i cant think of any part of the movie that be good  n  although i be hop that id like it a little more this be still certainly an impressive film there be great performance by all the lead and the story while not what id call chilling be still effective and it keep me interested for me the best part of this film be the look of the picture for it always look cold and damp and it just really seem to suit the film well i also think that the low budget suit this movie for i dont think that a crisp picture and clear sound would have work as well in a film this grim all thing consider it fell a little short of my expectation but im still very glad that i finally sit down to watch this movie  n  imagine this a high school except it boarding school and the kid dont have parent around oh and it in malibu and the kid be all thin white and gorgeous with the exceptional token minority or fat kid to play the weird outcast and there arent any reasonable rule like how they have cohabitation nuclear weapon in their dorm coffee stand a sushi bar and a complimentary laptop per student heres the story a girl zoey brook attend pca a formerly allboys school absolutely perfect in every possible way she be smart pretty thin athletic creative and everything a perfectionist want to be almost all the boy in school want her and every girl want to be her friend shes the one everyone come to for advice the one who save the day with a simplistic plan and be just wonderful too bad none of this make her likable are we suppose to believe that if we dont even come close to zoeys perfection be bad people in the show nothings her fault and if anyone contradict her theyre portray a the bad guy logan he may be a jerk but at least he have some kind of ain that think for himself instead of simply agree with the princess every time her loyal group of blind follower be chase the average dumb as that have a secret crush on her michael the token black guy and the only decent actor on the set lola a wannabe actress and anorexic snobby airhead quinn the smart but clueless girl when it come to teen stuff and logan the rich jerk who have a soft side yeah this show basically spew out stereotypes what tick me off though be that they all try to pretend theyre normal kid they complain that logan get too much money while they have to work themselves even though they already go to a toogoodtobetrue board school and have relatively nice thing that many teenager cant afford they drink coffee and eat sushi on a regular basis hardly have homework and suntan almost every day wow they have it hard any other problem im too goodlooking rich and stressfree i guess zoey whats the for anyway be nicks attempt at try to portray teen realistically except they catch a glimpse of reality didnt like it and decide to give the kid live like the ass on the hills but hey at least the set pretty  n  i have be amaze by director antals kontroll back in his first american project vacancy be less impressive but a decent start armor be his second feature and while the visual signature be recognizable the film never rise above the level of a b movie it a shame because the main premise have all the ingredient for twist and turn and the ensemble cast feature many quality actor should be able to deliver antal could have make a great heist film but instead go for an action flick then again he could have shoot a cool action flick but it doesnt really deliver in that department either what you be leave with be one implausible situation after another a group of poorly sketch character bicker and fight over a sum of money if you look past the sharp cinematography cast and the tight music score youre leave with what could have be a below average directtovideo feature van damme or seagal this be probably the most disappointing movie for me in quite some time  n  first of all the reason im give this film star instead of be because at least peter falk give his usual fantastic performance a lieutenant columbo he alone can get star for try to save this otherwise utterly worthless attempt at make a movie i be initially all fire up at read one poster comment that andrew stevens in this movie give the performance of his career to me it be the abysmal performance by stevens that absolutely ruin this movie and so i be all prepared to hurl all sort of insult at the person who make the aforementioned comment then i think to myself what else have stevens do so i checked and you know that person be absolutely right in the year since this columbo movie be make apparently every one of the project that stevens have be in since then have be utter crap so it be doubtful that anybody have even see the rest of his career if you like columbo see every other of the title before watch this one do yourself a favor and save the bad for last  n  this movie must be in line for the most boring movie in year not even woody harrison can save this movie from sink to the bottom the murder in this movie be suppose to be the point of interest in this movie but be not nothing be of any interest the cast be not to bad but the script be just plain awful i just sit in utter amazement during this movie think how on earth can anyone find this movie entertain the producer of this movie be very clever they make a boring movie but hid it well with the name of good actor and actress on their cast people will go to the blockbuster and probably see this movie and think woody harrison kristin scott thomas and willem dafoe this must be good and rent this movie boy be they in for a horrible time if you like get rip off go and rent this movie some people actually do enjoy this movie but i like to watch a movie with meaning  n  down at the movie gallery i saw a flick i just have to see it look like a fun lowbudget horror action western that i could get into yeah i know it would suck but i rent it anyway hop for laugh only a few laugh be to be find this be an extremely stupid movie it begin with a bounty hunter our protagonist who be possibly the weak main character in the history of film he looks acts like he could take on chuck norris but he cant his dialogue suck too anyway he go into a village shoot some zombie you could tell they try to make this long by put in these boring scene where he take minute to reload or watch some zombie at least the zombie look cool so anyway some people get shot some zombie die and in the end everyone be dead except our main character who should have die at the beginning when he be shoot down by four people  n  i be finally see the el padrino movie from what i can see it be an incredible film and lot of action damian chapa be good director but i must admit i love his act the best also i saw the behind the scene it be edit by some lady name kinga she need to go back to school and learn how to edit however the film el padrino be a pure action epic why cant most people who direct put together film that keep you wonder what the plot be i be so happy to see someone i know to be a real great actor become a great director also i be one of those people who love to see artist make it b s  n  i thrive on cinema      but there be a limit a name isnt enough to make a movie the beginning of the movie put u in a mood to expect the unseen yet but we remain hungry or angry   till the end thing be get so confused that i admit that i do not understand the end or be there an end to this nonesense the opportunity to make an outstanding movie be there but the target be totally missed next      n  michael callan play a smarmy photographer who seem nonetheless to be regard a a perfect catch by any woman that run across him could this have anything to do with the fact that he also coproduced the film hes a hero whom it very difficult to empathize with so the movie be in trouble right from the start however it trouble dont end there it have the production value of a tvmovie check out that head make of clay or something near the end and the end cheat in a way that i cant reveal in case anyone want to see the movie highly unlikely let just say that the killer know more than we be let to know he know     n  i be draw to friend by the soundtrack score by a very young and yet to be famous elton john whom i have see in a club in nearby houston i have no idea of the emotion and impact the movie would make recently i be ought back to the movie by a song that heart do call season then i find the elton john song friends think it be the same song     it be year of so anyway the flood of the emotion of friend come back like see an old photograph of your first real love i have more recall of the way the movie hit me than i do of the actual detail of the production plot etc so forgive me for a rather poor review i remember take a couple of special friend on a date to see the movie and them be a move and tearyeyed at the end a i be im both anxious and nervous to find a copy and see it now so many movie which seem so important to me back then i e the graduate easy rider now just seem silly and i dont want this to fall into the same category but i will find it and if it turn out silly then at least ill be able to turn my wife onto a great     no  outstanding soundtrack when we meet we go through this with last tango in paris the youngster i work with im respect my opinion but it hard to explain the feeling of the sixty and the movie and song that reflect such strong feeling but seem a little aged now i just cant figure out if the the aging process be the movie     or me friends be a very special sensitive and wonderful movie it will ing back a lot of special feeling im sure by all mean rent or buy a copy     indie be not near the strong genre then that they be today  n  during the clete robert preface i be begin to think this be an ed wood production however what roll out here be some pretty hard hit stuff the story of crime and corruption in a southern town be tell use a cast cull from hollywood poverty row and this make the movie all the more realistic there be no punch pull here and at time the film be reminiscent of the well the black and white texture give a newsreellike quality for certain young viewer will be remind of the blair witch project but this one be base on real event  n  i decide to watch this one because it be nominate for oscar this year i guess a many folk here i really want to like this movie but end up bored and disappointed first scene be ok but the whole rest of the movie in shaky hand camera mode be really annoying i guess the main reason for make such a movie and nominate it for oscar be this american military machine people who make money on war urgently need an excuse or justification of war in iraq by bungle up something sort of patriotic why these heroic effort of director and the main character to  inspire  the audience with an idea of lovingwarlikeadrug    oh please come on what a bore watch this to get an idea of how low the movie academy can fall      n  mom should really be give a different title to distinguish it from all the other movie out there call mom or with the word mom in the title this be a vastly superior zombie movie to so much of the rubbish that get churn out time after time and all end up much the same a every other zombie movie out there it be so different and refresh it almost defy categorisation the kind old lady who take in a creepy lodger who just happen to be a flesh eater who then infect the old lady who also turn into a flesh eating zombie or ghoul quite which exactly be not defined there be pathos in the story a her son realise what she have become and while at first horrify attempt to help her by supply food i shall say no more about that for fear of insert a spoiler it be one of those quiet movie a oppose to gun blast explosion rag car chase etc bore etc that make so many movie all the same rubbish but still with enough gory moment to satisfy horror fan whilst also insert sadness into the story along with nice touch of humour a oppose to downright silliness of some socalled horror movies there be a particularly nice atmospheric shot at the beginning of the film where the old lady be sit alone in her room with only her christmas tree for company and look so innocent but what she become oh my a gem of a movie and even if not your thing should at least be view if only once by any true horror fan  n  empire of passion start out deceptively that be if youre immediately expect it to be a horror movie it like a riff on james m  cains the postman always ring twice at first seki kazuko yoshiyuki be a mother of two and a dutiful hardworking wife to rickshaw driver gisaburo takahiro tamura but when he not around and shes at home with the baby the feisty and aimless young man toyoji tatsuya fuji come around to ing some goody for seki     and a little extra theyre soon sleep together but after he do something to her let just say a shave he know that hell find out and immediately propose that they kill gisaburo they drink him up strangle him and then toss him down a well naturally this will come back to haunt them but that it literally at least to them at first superterrified seki and then only later on skeptical toyoji change gear into the kaidan a japanese ghost story this be a film where the horror come not simply out of oh ghost ah but out of the total dread that build for the character in a way theres the mechanic of a filmnoir at work throughout if only loosely translate by way of a th century japanese village a oppose to an american city or small town i e the snoop cop the evidence find possibly by another word get around suspicion arouse etc it compelling because seiko actually be against the plan from the start manipulate by the lustful but illprepared toyoji and her reaction to gisaburos reappearance be stagger to her take the one that come close to poetry gisaburos ghost paleblue face and mostly silent chill stare motion for seiko to get on the rickshaw she do reluctantly and he push her around on a road she doesnt know in the wee hour before dawn surround by smoke most japanese ghost story wish to heaven they could get this harrowingly atmospheric while it start to veer into hysteric towards the end theres so much here that director oshima get right in make this a distinctive work after hit it huge in the international cinema world with in the realm of the sens which ironically get ban in his own country he make something that he claim be even  more  dare that sense maybe he be right empire of passion have less graphic sexual content by far than it predecessor also star tatsuya fuji a magnificently physical actor with an immense lot of range but it daring lie in craft a world of dread you can believe in ghost in this story but you also have to believe how far down to their own personal hell these two wouldbe lovebird will go the snoop detective or the gossiping townspeople be the least of their worry the fate of their very soul be at stake and oshima take what in other hand could be merely juicy pulp sadly it wouldnt surprise me if an american remake be already in the work and craft shot after gorgeous shot with repetition work it way into the misenscene i e the shot of seiko and toyoji walking on that road the camera at a dutch angle the world tilt and surround them in a grim blue hue as well a some affect movement that will stay with me long after i finish type this i e toyoji throw the leaf by one hand into the well in slow motion or how seikos nude body be reveal after she become blind it dare lie in connect on a level of the spirit not to be confuse with the spiritual though there may be something with that as well about life and death connection to one another inextricably it a classic waiting to be discover  n  i be not a big music video fan i think music video take away personal feeling about a particular song   any song in other word creative thinking go out the window likewise personal feeling aside about mj toss aside this be the best music video of alltime simply wonderful it be a movie yes folks it be brilliant you have awesome acting awesome choreography and awesome singing this be spectacular simply a plot line of a beautiful young lady date a man but be he a man or something sinister vincent price do his thing add to the song and video mj be mj enough say about that this song be to video what jaguar be for car top of the line perfecto what be even good about this be that we get the real mj without the thousand facelift though ironically enough there be more than enough makeup and costume to go around folk go to youtube take min out of your life and see for yourself what a wonderful work of art this particular video really be  n  oh my goodness i would have never think it be possible for me to see a thriller bad than domestic disturbance this soon but here it be arm with rotten plot terrible edit stilted acting and headacheinducing style sorry i have no other word for it sanctimony be the kind of movie that almost force you to reevaluate an entire genre that be this film be so bad that even the thriller i condemn a complete failure now seem a little better now not only sanctimony be a terrible film in itself it also succeed in the difficult task of rip off good movie and do a pathetic job with it right from the main title nothing but a blatant attempt to reproduce the one from see i be under the impression that something didnt smell quite right as soon a the movie start with a series of corny wannabe hip quickcuts full of gory image and bombastic color i know where that smell be come from it turn out that two policeman or rather policeman jim renart michael par   and policewoman dorothy smith jennifer rubin be investigate on a murder spree in vancouver a serial killer know a monkey killer what a menace chilling nickname uh for his work method have kill quite a lot of people you see this nut apparently work follow the proverb see no evil hear no evil speak no evil and cut eye ear and tongue out of his victim so far six eye six ear and three tongue in very ingenious fashion renart and smith figure out that the monkey killer be probably go to kill other three people     well because he probably want to complete the number so suddenly the film focus on tom gerrick casper van dien a young successful goodlooking businessman with a dreadful temper and thats where the ripoff of american psycho kick in so we follow the life of the two police officer and the young psychopath none of which be interest in the least until they finally meet along the way to that a disco where renart barely miss gerrick unintentionally offer u one of the funny scene in recent memory renart go in the back of the disco club because     well just because the script tell u it a suspect place then with one single punch in the stomach renard get rid of a big guard who block the path and the guard be never hear of again do this scene strike anyone else a completely unrealistic anyway after another murder gerrick turn in a a witness but smith and especially renart immediately suspect he might be the killer in typical basic instinct fashion smith get some date with the young businessman under the assumption that she might discover his true identity i wont spoil the end but it be quite simply an embarrassment there be contradiction some plot hole issue that never get resolve and especially there be one last scene where a utal mass murder suppose to be shock and sad come off a such laughably overdone and nonsensical that i frankly cant imagine how anyone could not laugh at it at minute sanctimony be really push it you never care about one single character because they be all so flat not to mention bore that you know exactly who be who the first time you meet them you be never pull into the story because the scene be connect through weak plot device when not downright unnecessary and out of place the act range from average van dien to downright atrocious rubin and most of the support cast the music be abysmal generic techno and the photography be one of the bad i have ever see of course like every fiasco of the genre we be provide with a little bit of gratuitous nudity    n  the man with a golden arm be one of a trio of great film around that same time that dealt with drug addiction the other two be monkey on my back and a hatful of rain but i think of the three this one be the best maybe if otto preminger have shoot the thing in the real chicago instead of those obvious studio set the film might have be good yet who know maybe preminger couldnt get enough money to pay for the location it the only flaw i find in the film frank sinatra be a heroin addict card dealer who be bust for cover for his bos robert strauss when the game be raid he take the cure while in jail and want a new life a a jazz drummer but a whole lot of people be conspire against him first bob strauss who want him back deal especially because a couple of heavyweight gambler be in town he use a few underhanded method to get sinatras service back secondly darren mcgavin be the local dope dealer who want sinatra good and hook a a customer again and finally eleanor parker his cling wife who work a con game to beat all just to keep him around frank sinatra get a nomination for best actor for this film but lose to ernest borgnine in marty sinatra might have win for this one if he hadnt win for from here to eternity in the support actor category a few year back and that marty be such an acclaimed film in that year his scene go through withdrawal lock up in kim novaks apartment will leave you shaken eleanor parker do not get enough credit for her role shes really something a the crazy scheme wife who want sinatra tie to her no matter what the cost if she have not be nominate that same year for interrupted melody she might have be nominate for this mark the high point of her career darren mcgavin get his first real notice a the very serpentine drug peddler his performance be guarantee to make your flesh crawl elmer bernstein contribute a great jazz score to accentuate the general dinginess of the bleak chicago neighborhood the character live in not a place youd want to ing up your family  n  this film be basically set up for failure by the studio one anne rice author of the book offer to write the screen play but be refuse by the studio two they try to stuff in depth novel in to a hour movie i maintain the only way for these two book vampire lestat and queen of the damn to work in a live action form would be through a miniseries first off the the vampire lestat alone take place from the s to the s and have a plethora of character vital to the plot understanding of the main character lestat the entire book vampire lestat set up the event of the second part queen of the damn without that full understand the premise of a movie be destroyed lestat be not cruel and vicious to all he be not want to go along with akashas plan marius do not make lestat lestat do not love jesse or make her lestat could not go remain unscathed by the light marius be not after david nor the other way around every character be completely represent wrong basically same names different story if they want to make a vampire movie fine even if you want to be inspire by these novel fine but dont piggie back into the theater off the success of rice great novel and character just to destroy what her loyal reader have come to love if you havent read the book you wont understand the film really if you have read the book you will be insult that be say i be such a huge fan i have to see the movie know full well this be go to be the case and still go for it catch must see it will hate it  n  have previously enjoy wesley snipe in several action flick and i have expect a lot more even from a score of imdb the movie fail to entertain and even though the story be thin and unoriginal the acting be most unfortunately thinner and go to mimic a bad case scenario of play strong feeling accompany by some bad acting     dont waist your time this movie    xadsnt entertain if you wan na cry it might suffice though even though your tear will be wept due to see wesley snipe in the tragic action film wannabe comedy     i give this it really be awful if you wan na see a decent movie go see shooter or rent it it all the good thing this movie isnt  n  an intense thriller about a mute movie makeup artist who witness a snuff film be make when she be work late in the studio one night after she try to get away from the murder scene she realize she be in for more than she bargain for when the entire mafia be out to kill her for be a witness this movie leave you on the edge of your seat  n  dont listen to most of these people ill give you a good review of this movie which me and my friend love it about jill johnson play by camilla belle who babysits at the mendrakis house and someone eaks in if youre wonder how he get in the house he go through the garage most likely so anyway dont listen to the bad act it have amazing act with a great story i think that there be benefit that jill have shes a fast runner and be on the track team  she get out alive lol it be a cool movie and quite scary check it out you will be happy with this masterpiece dont listen to the other people on the site it very good trust me i be good at review movie im a future movie critic i totally want to buy this movie and you will too when you see it it be amazingly awesome  n  what a frustrating movie a small southern town be overflow with possibility for explore the complexity of interpersonal relationship and dark underbelly hide beneath placid surface a anyone who have read anything by carson mccullers already know this do none of that instead the writer settle for cutesy twinkle cheap warm fuzzies and banal melodrama the thing look like a madefortv movie and be direct with no particular distinction but it hard to imagine what anyone could have do to make this material interesting the most frustrating aspect though be the fact that there be a lot of extremely competent and appeal actor in this cast all try gamely to make the best of thing and do what they can with thiswell there no other word for itdrivel a tragic waste of talent in particular that of the great stockard channing  n  this movie star a totally forgotten star from the s jack pearl radio baron munchausen as well a jimmy durante however decades later it be bill a a three stooge film because they be the only one in the film who the average person would recognize today film fanatic will also recognize the wonderful edna may oliver as well a zazu pitts as for the stooge this be a film from there very early daysbefore mgm have any idea what to do with the team at this point they be know a ted healy and his stooge a healy be the front man fortunately for the stooge they soon leave this nasty and rather untalented man read up on himyoull see what i mean and the rest be history within a year they be make very successful short for columbia and executive at mgm be soon kick themselves for lose the team this sort of thing be a common occurrence at mgm a great studio which have no idea what to do with comedy such a the film of buster keaton laurel and hardy abbott and costello and others in fact up until they leave for columbia mgm put them in a wide variety of odd film rolesincluding act with clark gable and joan crawford in dance lady and oddly in this film they didnt act a a teamthey just do various support role such a larry play the piano this particular film begin with pearl and durante lose in the african jungle when they be rescue and ought home all sense of structure to the film fall apart and the film become almost like a variety showpunctuated by scene with the lead here and there a for pearl i could really see why he never make a successful transition to film a he have the personality of a slug but slightly less welcome a for durante i never know what the public saw in himas least as far a his film be concernedhe be loud and     loud he apparently take time off from help mgm to ruin buster keaton career to make this film together pearl and durante rely on lot of verbal humor and vaudevillestyle routine that tend to fall rather flat in this film the stooge they didnt yet have the right chemistry see healy do the job that moe do in their late film be odd what they do in the film be pretty good but because all the segment be short they come on and off camera too quickly to allow them to really get into their routine stooge fan might be very frustrate at this though diehard fan may want to see this so that they can complete their lifelong goal of see everything stoogeeven the rotten joe derita and joe besser film oh and do they get bad after the death of shemp and curly  overall the film be rather dull and disappointing however there be a couple interesting thing to look for in the mess at about the minute mark you will see a ief scene where a tour guide on a bus be sing look carefully a this be walter brennan in a role youd certainly never expect another unusual thing to look for in the film be the clean a a whistle song start at about minute into the film this song and dance number be clearly an example of a socalled precode scene that never would have be allow in film after when the production code be strengthen despite the word clean in the title it a very titillating number with naked woman show lot of fleshenough to stimulate but not enough to really show anything it quite shocking when see today though such excess be pretty common in the early s  finally at the minute mark see jimmy durante set race relation back a few decade see the film youll see that i mean  n  when carol vanessa hidalgo start look into her others death she begin to suspect something more sinister than natural cause the closer she get to the truth the more of a threat she become to her sisterinlaw fiona helga line and the rest of the local satanist theyll do whatever be necessary to put a stop her nosy ways if youre into sleazy satanicthemed movie black candle have a lot to offer the movie be fill with plenty of nudity and ritualistic softcore sex one scene in particular involve a young woman and a goat must be see to be believe unfortunately all the sleaze in the world cant save black candle most of the movie be a total bore other than the one scene ive already mention the numerous sex scene arent shocking and certainly arent sexy the acting be spotty at best even genre favorite helga line give a disappointing performance the plot really doesnt matter it main function seem to be to hold the string of dull sex scene together im only familiar with one other movie direct by jose ramon larraz compare with his daughter of darkness that masterfully mix eroticism and horror black candle come off a amateurish be about the best i can do  n  one of the more intelligent serial killer movie in recent history zodiac killer offer an imaginative take on the background and history of one of the most notorious serial killer the filmmaker create an unexpectedly good insight into the pathology of this mysterious killer and anyone who remember zodiac will be intrigue others will want to discover more about this enigmatic criminal unlike many serial killer zodiac be not insane at all but very methodical and a selfpromoter the director here play viewer expectation and pull it off the film be construct a a murder mystery or a cold casestyle thriller it be an intelligent investigative proceduralstyle horror film that will putoff gorehounds in search of cheap thrills some people dislike any movie that be shoot on video this attitude be very oldstyle and provincial it be an attitude and view of movie that put technical issue above entertainment value or artistic value these attitude be on the way out zodiac killer be a lowbudget film no doubt but discern viewer will look beyond that and find a carefullycrafted gem  n  ive read the other review and find some to be comparison of movie v real life eg what it take to get into music school britney bash etc etc so lets focus on the movie and the message i have rat this movie out of for the age range to year and for a family movie for the average adult male     out of  i like pop rock music im i know of britney spear but never realise she actually sing strong until i read the credit and these review i didnt recognise her poster on the wall so i be not worried about any self promotion i watch movie to be entertain i dont care about cast light producer director etc what be the movie and do it entertain me i watch this movie for the message the world great epidemic be low selfesteem which be a whole other story so watched with the message in mind a that be an area of interest the movie be light ight and eezy great for kid i find the texan twang begin to fade throughout the movie and of course there be only so many way to convey the give up dont give up message so yeh it be a bit predictable great message though     should be more of them this movie be a great family movie but for a bloke watching by himself get hannibal  n  i like this movie because it be a fine work of cinema make by people who care enough to make it art and not just home movie it be fill with supersurfer greg nolls home movie and a boatload of amateur video from others who align themselves with his year passion nevertheless it have be expand to the degree that it approach aesthetic glory it be fill with artistic talent and athletic talent however trivial you might think surf to be athletic surfer be not astronaut nor testpilots nor be they surgeon perhaps or ph ds again perhaps it believe in the quest of the surfer it believe in the beauty of human goofiness it believe in the great gift of peace which come from the cessation of war surfer celeate the cessation of war on the north beach of an hawaiian island attack by japanese zero fifteen year before it celeates the downtime of a country which fight a cold warinstead of a hotwar with the russian socialist surf be the ultimate narcissism it be dangerous but only slightly historical i suspect alexander the great would not be celeated for his surfing technique he have to go out and conquer a few dozen country to get the favorable press he have receive this movie have no military hero it have no gun the only beachhead surfer conquer have a beerstand and and a surfboard shop this be not a problem peace be not desperate it be the joy of exhalation  n  i have a hard time stay awake for the two hour open episode it be dumbed down to such an extent i doubt if i learn a single thing the graphic be rudimentary any small idea be repeat ad nauseum contrast this to the cosmos series host by carl sagan that have a good musical theme there be no music come from these infernal dimensional string  n  although the plot of this film be a bit farfetched it be worth see just for the performance of michael caine and gambon the latter delivers a truly wonderful dublin accent caine ham it up     which be exactly what the character he be play should do entertain and fun this be a hour and a half of easy watch  n  this movie be so badly write direct and act that it beggar belief it should be remake with a good script director and casting service the bad problem be the act you have jennifer beals on the one hand who be polish professional and totally believable and on the other hand richard who be woefully miscast and just jarring in this particular piece peter gallagher and jenny levine be just awful a the slave owning and keep couple although both normally do fine work the actor and director should not have attempt to do accent at allthey be inconsistent and unbelievable much good to have concentrate on do a good job in actual english the casting be ludicrous why have child of an african merchant thus less socially desirable to the gen de couleur society be cast with very pale skin actor while the supposedly socially desirable marcel have pronounce african feature include an obviously dyed blond fro it a if the casting director can not be bother to read the script they be cast and to choose appropriate actor from a large pool of extremely talented and physically diverse actor of color it just so weird this could be a great movie and should be remake but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and skilled actor there be plenty of good actor out there and it would be fun to see how jennifer beals daniel sunjata and gloria reuben would do with an appropriate cast good script and decent direction  n  when i be a young oh about i watch barney for the first time and like it but back then i didnt exactly have a ain either and now i look back and see what a horrible show barney really be first of all everything on that show be creepy barney the main character be a horrendous foot tall talk purple dinosaur that teach yearolds about imagination      shudders  b j i know what your think about his name be a small yet creepy yellow dinosaur that be put in to be supposudly cool but in fact he be the exact opposite after watch a few episode with b j dumbly trudge in with his slightly turn back cap and make a few nosofunny joke i want to scream baby bopohohgod  vomits  ohohohanyway baby bop be the bad idea of a character ever she be a green triceratops it a dinosaur that carry a yellow blanket her remark of heeheehee and barneys praise cry of superdeeeedoooper make it hard to sit through each episode a the seventh grader learn about shape and manners and that my friend be what make this show truly horrible  n  steve mcqueen have certainly a lot of loyal fan out there he certainly be a charismatic fellow one of the most charismatic the big screen ever know but even mcqueen cant save this turkey of a film shot with what look like a ownie camera in the actual location in st  louis mcqueens a new kid with no criminal record ought into the planning of a bank heist by one of the other gang theres more than a oad hint that theres a gay relationship go on between young steve and david clarke he not like at all by the other heist member mainly because of his lack of criminal resume steve also have a girl friend in molly mccarthy and she suspect something afoot especially when he start hang around with crahan denton and james dukas as well a clarke all pretty rough character that would certainly get my suspicion aroused the great st  louis bank robbery have two director charles guggenheim and john stix guggenheim do mostly documentary and stix didnt do much of anything one of those two joker decide steves performance be best serve by do a bad marlon brando imitation this film may go down a the bad ever do by steve mcqueen im willing to bet that dick powell and four star production have already sign him for want dead or alive because i cant believe they would have if they saw this or they would have see something the public would have overlook except for the dressing for this turkey  n  this be a bad film a it central message be very muddled and the plot seem like it be the result of merge several disparate script a a result it often make absolutely no sense at all and certainly be not a film miss dunne or mr  huston should have be proud of make however the film be worth watch if you be a fan of precode film because it feature an amazingly sleazy plot that strongly say that nice girl do put outeven if they arent marry and even if their partner be the film begin with miss dunne a a social worker assist troop head to europe for wwi in the process she meet a scalawag bruce cabot who eventually convince her to sleep with him she become pregnant and he then go on to the next unsuspecting woman however miss dunne do not want him back a she realize he not worth it but later her baby die at child birth while all these very controversial plot element be use they be always allude toalmost like they want the adult in the audience to know but hop that if they phrase it or film it in just the right way kid in the audience will be clueless after all film be not rat and kid might attend any film at this time  surprisingly this entire plot involve a stillborn baby and cabot end about of the way through the film and be never mention again or allude to it be a if they film part of a movie and abandon ittacking it on to still another film in this second phase of the film miss dunne unexpectedly begin work at a womens prison though we actually never really get to see her do anything there what we do see be countless horrible scene of severe abuse and torture that be probably design to titillate and a a result of all this violence miss dunne go on a crusade to clean up the prison and become a reformer and famous writer but then out of the blue another type of film emerges and the woman prison reform business go by the wayside dunne meet a judge walter huston who be married but he desperately want her now throughout the film dunne be portray a a very good girleven though she do have unmarried sex with cabot she be more or less trick into it but now single irene who be a tireless reformer and good lady begin sleep with a married man he tell her that he and his wife be estrange and be marry in name only but she never think to investigate if this be true and with his assurance off fly her clothes and they be in the baby making business but while shes pregnant with his love child he indict for be a crooked judge he assure her hes innocent but he convict and it sure sound like he a scoundrelusing inside information from people that have come before his bench in order to amass a fortune then in the final moment of the film miss dunne try in vain to get him free and vow to wait with the child until huston be release the film then ends so we basically have three separate film and a bizarre early s idea of what a nice girl should be like i gather that she should be a strongminded working girl who instantly become an idiot in her personal relationship this really undo all the positive about dunnes character and it really hard to imagine anyone like the film a strong woman right advocate might easily be offend at how weakminded and needy she be and religious people might see her a totally amoral or at least morally suspect with a decent rewrite this could have be a good film or at least interesting a a lewd and salacious film but it couldnt make up it mind what it want to be and be just another dull precode film  n  i catch this movie on the scifi channel recently it actually turn out to be pretty decent as far a blist horror suspense film go two guy one naive and one loud mouth a   take a road trip to stop a wedding but have the bad possible luck when a maniac in a freaky makeshift tank truck hyid decide to play catandmouse with them thing be far complicate when they pick up a ridiculously whorish hitchhiker what make this film unique be that the combination of comedy and terror actually work in this movie unlike so many others the two guy be likable enough and there be some good chase suspense scene nice pacing and comic timing make this movie more than passable for the horror slasher buff definitely worth check out  n  very mild spoiler a basic plot outline no real detail if you go into this movie with sufficiently low expectation i saw this film at a free screen a few day ago in maryland and the only reason i agree to go     be because it be free i expect a few chuckle but a i have never be a huge fan of tenacious d not much more then that the first ten minute of the film be hilarious a we be give a look at jack black humble christian origin in a midwest american town the film then take u year into the future to the first meeting between jb and kyle gas the second half of tenacious d  we see the formation of the band and the genesis of it name finally a the title suggest the second half of the film detail their quest to obtain the fabled pick of destiny again the beginning of the film be laugh out loud funny and most of the movie at least keep a smile on my face that say there be time it felt a bit long it only minute but it still felt like it should have be a bit short the story be every bit as absurd a it sound and this be not a film you see if you want a real plot which be fine except it mean that many of the joke be very hit or miss     and when they miss they miss bad same thing with the song it be a musical but many of the song lose their appeal after the first minute or so     then keep go anyway i will say that the rrating really save this movie from bomb the d humor simply couldnt work without cuss sex and drug reference but unless youre a real fan of the band or at the very least know you appreciate their style of comedy i would recommend you save yourself some money and rent pick will make you giggle a bit     but be it worth buck i dont think so i be tempt to rate it a but since i do think that many would enjoy it enough to justify see it in theatres a seem more appropriate just be sure it your style  n  i shall begin with a disclaimer this movie be not recommend for anyone who lack interest or have never play ff the game before watch the movie rely on the audience knowledge of each character in the game to convey story plot element and it do so very subtly do your homework before watch this wonderful piece of cg film and i promise itll be that much better with that in mind this film have some of the most spectacular cg sequence i have ever witness the whole experience felt like an extra long fmv sequence from the game on steroid yeah the attention to detail in each scene especially in the heavy action orient one be so impeccable it leave me with a sense of awe i believe the soundtrack be simplify so a to help the audience focus on the animation quality more than the music again for those who be familiar with the ff story and background the music should not surprise anyone although the timing and placement of each soundtrack from the original accompany each scene and mood to the point where the music simply enhance the animation  once again i myself have only play through ff once thoroughly enjoy this piece of art from square enix and that be the feel in most scene choreograph and organize like a dance in short if you enjoy the music or the game final fantasy this film will blow you out of the water if youre in the unfortunate majority who have not experience the goodness know a ff on playstation or pc do so before watch the movie will allow for an exponentially great experience finally i just want to make a note of the quality in animate this film character move with fluidity each scene background come to life and tell it own story for those who criticize the thinness and dependency of the story plot i urge you to reexamine the animation facial reaction subtle clue that ing about another level of entertainment above the typical narration method of story plot delivery square enix and the great tetsuya nomura have set a new bar for quality animation and storytelling advent child have usher in a new era for cg animation allow the subtlety that lie in each character to speak volume in and of themselves thanks square enix the wait be well worth it  n  this be quite possibly one of the bad movie ever make everything about itacting direct script cinematographyis dreadful the alien a human in sparkly suit claim to be from a nearby universe one assume the scriptwriter mean galaxy but didnt bother to get a dictionary to check his term a good title for the film would be it come from the planet of plot contrivance the plot be excessively silly and nearly nonexistent the human be all give magical macguffin that conform to a tortuous series of unlikely restriction just to move the bare plot any thought to the passage of time be ignore now it a couple day after meet the alien then bam all of a sudden theres only a couple hour leave until zero hour do yourself a favor and miss this movie you will make yourself stupid for have watch it the end be particularly silly and should have be accompany by someone go tada a the scriptwriter just pull something random out of his butt i think the real alien plot be that this movie suck so bad youll get cancer watch it if you can watch the last minute without crap yourself enemy of freedomhonestly laugh youre retard  n  if you really really really enjoy movie feature ant build dirtmirrors eat nonants and conquer the world with a voiceover narrative then this be the movie for you basically a couple of scientist work out of a biodome communicate with highly intelligent ant the most intelligent actor in this film in an attempt to try to thwart their plan of conquest and extermination throughout the movie the two scientist and a girl they rescue from the ant use everything at their disposal computer green dye and horrid act but to no avail i guess they just couldnt afford any pesticide because the movie would be over too quickly the title of the movie phase iv be something of a mystery this be not a spoiler but phase i start right after the opening credit whereas you dont reach phase iv until the end credit roll apparently the director know the movie would be tedious to get through and so placed phase throughout the movie a a kind of progress report hang in there buddy only more phase until final credit a a mstk episode this one wasnt very good for two reason this one be from the season on ktma when they be first start out so the riffing be not as good a in late season and this movie be so bad not even j tb can lighten it up there be one or two gamera reference a they have just finish riff gamera movies the movie do have a trick surprise end but i be so glad to reach the end the effect be lose on me  n  joseph brady and clarence doolittle be two sailor who have a fourday shore leave in hollywood joe know everything about girl and cant wait to see lola while clarence be shy and need some advice from his buddy on how to meet girls they then run into a little boy donald martin who have run away in order to join the navy they take him home and meet his beautiful aunt susan who want to be a singer clarence want susie to be his girl but his shyness get in the way but he doesnt feel shy with a waitress who come from brooklyn like he does soon joe notice he in love with susie the boy be in a fix when they lie to susie on meeting with a big time music producer they dont even know as they be in a fix with their feelings george sidney anchor aweigh be a great musical comedy gene kelly be topnotch once again in his singing and dance routines frank sinatra be terrific a the shy guy from brooklyn shy isnt the first thing that come to mind when you think of frank sinatra but he play his part well kathryn grayson be fantastic a susan abbott we sadly lose this gifted actress and operatic soprano singer last month at the age of  the year old dean stockwell do amazing job a the little fellow want to become a sailor jose iturbi do great job perform himself its magic what he do with the piano edgar kennedy play chief of police station sara berner be the voice of jerry mouse theres a lot of great stuff in this movie and some fantastic singing and dance numbers just look at kelly and sinatra performing we hate to leave its so energetic if you know susie like i know susie be quite funny its a nice moment when frank sings brahms lullaby to little dean stockwell its lovely to listen to grayson sing the tango jealousy  the most memorable sequence be the one that take into the animate fantasy world and there gene sings and dance with jerry mouse also tom cat be see there a the butler they originally ask mickey mouse but he refused the movie be nominate for five oscar but georgie stoll get one for original music score anchors aweigh be some high class entertainment  n  from director barbet schroder reversal of fortune i think i saw a bit of this in my medium study class and i recognise the lead actress so i try it despite the rating by the critic basically cool kid richard haywood half nelson ryan gosling and justin pendleton bully michael pitt team up to murder a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away with it without the police find them investigate the murder be homicide detective cassie the hyena mayweather sandra bullock with new partner sam kennedy ben chaplin who be pretty baffle by the evidence find on the scene e g nonrelating hair the plan doesnt seem to be completely go well because cassie and sam do quite quickly have richard or justin a suspect it be just a question of if they can sway them away also star agnes bruckner a lisa mill chris penn a ray feather r d call a captain rod cody and tom verica a asst d a al swanson i can see now the same concept a sir alfred hitchcock rope with the murdering for a challenge thing but this film do it in a very silly way and not even a reasonably good bullock can save it from be dull and predictable adequate  n  thing to come be an early scifi film that show an imagined world or everytown through year you can eak it up into about different scene or part the film span from to and be mainly about how this ruler or the bos want to get the capability to fly in airplane again after everytown be bomb and war oke out this film only have about fault it audio be muddy and video have some quirk the character arent deep at all and the overall plot isnt altogether solid the plot be lack something that i cant put my finger on     it just seem a little fluffy but if you love scifi and be interested in what h g well though might happen in the next hundred year this be a must see it worth seeing just to learn of what everyone be fear a long drawnout war because they be just about to go to war with germany and there be a threat of biological weapon and everything things to come be a pretty good movie that most people need to see once  n  weakstale tire cliched want to be basic instinct but miss opportunity after opportunity for fresh perspective new insight insipid trite grotesque and without the possiblyredeeming value of evity oh wait     it be only minute long     it must have just  seemed  a lot long id rather clean bus station toilet with my toothush than have to sit through this again im express an opinion here i guess this mean i didnt like it  n  one word can describe this movie and that be weird i record this movie one day because it be a japanese animation and it be old so i think it would be interest well it be the movie be about a young boy who travel the universe to get a metal body so he can seek revenge on the way he meet very colorful character and must ultimately decide if he want the body or not very strange if you be a fan of animation sciencefiction you might want to check this out  n  while i be the video store i be owsing through the one dollar rental and come upon this little gem i dont know what it be about it but i just have a gut instic about it and wow be i ever right the story center around two girl who have just survive a school shoot one of the girl be alicia a teenage reble who be the only witness for the full attack and another be deanna another survivor who survive a bullet to the head by some miracle throw together by fate they slowly begin a painful and beautiful display of healing and move on i just hate it when amaze movie fall through the crack because wow what a performance by busy phillips and erkia christensen not to mention the rest of the cast my only complaint be that the dvd be sorely lack in special feature oh and some of the jump cut in the movie be kind of jar but all in all a excellent movie  n  this film be quite simply one of the bad film ever make and be a damn indictment on not only the british film industry but the talentless hack at work today not only do the film get mainstream distribution it also feature a good cast of british actor so what go wrong i dont know and simply i dont care enough to engage with the debate because the film be so terrible it deserve no thought at all be warn and stay the hell away from this rubbish but apparently i need to write ten line of text in this review so i might as well detail the plot a nob of a man be setup by his evil friend and coworker out of his father company and thus lead to an encounter with the russian mafia and dodgy accent and stupid very stupid plot twists devices i should have ask for my money back but be perhaps still in shock from the experience if you want a good crime film watch the usual suspect or the godfather what about lock stock     thats the peak of the contemporary british crime film         n  ill not comment a lot whats to stereotype character absolute ignorance about colombia reality awful mise en scene poor color choice not funny it suppose to be a comedy and they expect that you will laugh because some distend music it beside the nonsense scene very poor actor direction if you see somewhere those people i mean the interpreter youll know they be at least good but see this so call film it be impossible to guess it you get tire of the music     this comedy have no rhythm the only good rhythm in it it the rap sing in the final credit      pathetic doesnt it etc     etc     it have be a long time i havent see a movie so bad  n  this movie be a riot i can not remember the last time i have such a great time at the movie ive see a few good comedy in my time and usually they be pretty funny but this one be wall to wall great line i think best in show be the last movie that i laugh so hard and so much in the movie be nonstop until the end when they do the minute of sentimental plot clean up other than that it a constant barrage of one liner and goofy situation id like to see it again before it leave the theater because this be like the zucker movie where you dont get all the joke the first time around you have to see it two or three time to get it all in as far a the actual film go it could have use a good edit it choppy at time but we have to be forgive for that all the character be great it not like an adam sandler movie where he try to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and be the butt of the joke i think i will remember all the main character for year to come because they be all so likable no victim in this movie also thank god they get a year old actress to play his girlfriend catherine keener play her and she be a sweetheart in this film you just wish that woman like her really existed shes not a like some of the other leading lady but somehow her smile be warm than julia robert overdo overbite if you see the trailer for this film you may not think too highly of it i assure you the trailer do not do it justice they do not give away all the good joke just some of the mediocre ones oh and one more thing i hope critic put this on their top ten list many of them complain that comedy dont get the recognition they deserve and then at the end of the year they dont put it on their list this mean you ebert  n  a fey story of a martian attempt to colonize earth thing must be pretty bad back on mar two state trooper investigate the scene of a report ufo crash whatever land be bury under the ice at tracys pond but there be footstep in the snow lead to a nearby diner the diner have have no customer since eleven oclock that morning now there be a handful of bus passenger sit around wait for permission to cross a structurally weak idge the bus driver insist that six passenger be aboard the bus although he didnt notice who they be the problem be that there be now seven people wait for the journey to be resume one of them be an alien but which one all of them be suspect there the crazy old man jack elam of course who seem to exercise a sub rosa wit theres a blustering businessman who must get to boston john hoyt a young couple on their honeymoon execrable performance by the husband ron kipling except for the couple nobody have notice anyone else and even the couple be suspicious of each other bride to newly mint husband i could have swear you have a mole on your chin the story continue in a sprightly but slightly spooky way the phone ring for no reason the light go on and off the juke box turn itself on and none of it be to be take seriously its a thoroughly enjoyable ensemble play and the climactic revelation be worth a chuckle there be no discernible depth to it it not a moral message about pod people masquerade a normal citizen it not a warning of any kind just a fairy tale that divert and amuses i always enjoy it when it on it especially interesting to see john hoyt a the irritable and impatient businessman know that in he be the roman senator who mastermind the assassination of julius caesar in mgms version of shakespeare play and here he be with three arms oops  n  it rare that i feel a need to write a review on this site but this film be very deserving because of how poorly it be create and how bias it product was i felt a distinct attempt on the part of the filmmaker to display the palestinian family a boorish and untrustworthy we hear them discuss the sadness that they feel from oppression yet the film be shot and arrange in a way that we feel the politically oppressed population be the jewish israeli population we see no evidence that parallel the position of the palestinian teenager we only hear from other palestinian in prison i understand restriction be in place but the political nature of the restriction be design to prevent peace i come out of the film feeling that the mother of the victim be selfish in her mourning and completely close mind due to her side of the fence so to speak she continue to be unwilling to see the hurt of the bomber parent and her angry and closedminded word cause the final meeting to spiral out of control it be more realistic in my mind to see the israeli mindset to be a root of the problem ignore plea for understanding and freedom ignore request for acknowledgment for the process by which the jewish population acquire the land i have give this a two because of these selfish weakness of the mother which normally would be admirable in a documentary however in the light of the lack of impartiality it all seem exploitative also for the poor edits lack of background in the actual instance and finally the lack of proper representation of the palestinian side ultimately it be a poor documentary and a poor film i acknowledge this be partially the result of the political situation but be oblige to note the flaw in direction regardless of the heartwrenching and sad subject matter  n  relentless like one of those loud action movie the entire cast seem to be on speed i didnt quite get the director intention if any i wonder if shes ever see a stanley donen vincent minnelli or even a george sidney musical structure please this be one hell of a mess and i love abba the costume the unflattering photography unflattering towards the actor but love towards the location the one thing that make the whole thing bearable be the sight of meryl streep make a fool of herself no chemistry with her friend christine baranski and julie walter think of streep with lily tomlyn in the altman film and youll understand what i be hop for i be embarrass in particular by pierce brosnam and colin firth the audience however seem to enjoy it so it probably it just me  n  this movie do a great job of explain the problem that we face and the fear that we have before we put man into space a a history of space flight it be still use today in classroom that can get one of the rare print of it disney have show it on vault disney and i wish they would do so again  n  in an alternate s where an outeak of the undead cause by a mysterious spacedust have be contain through the use of special electronic collar a young loner timmy find a friend in fido billy connelly his family recently acquire domesticated zombie fido quickly become a surrogate father to timmy whose real dad be unable to adequately express his love for his son or for his hottotrot wife play by the gorgeous carrieanne moss have be psychologically scar a a child when he be force to shoot his own father who try to eat him  timmy run into a spot of bother however when his putrid pal collar go on the blink and he attack and kill an elderly neighbour with the authority on fidos trail trouble ewing with a pair of local bully and his mother form a bond with their undead househelp will timmy be able to hold on to his new find friend a refresh take on the whole zombie schtick fido be a thoroughly entertain deliciously dark comedy that should appeal to anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humour take the romero zombieverse and transplant it into s small town america be a stroke of genius and the result be simply one of the most original film to tackle the whole reanimate dead theme that i have seen connellys fido be a cinematic zombie worthy of inclusion in the undead movie hall of fame along with day of the dead bub and return of the living deads tarman it be not often i feel empathy for a walking corpse but the big yin performance be so fine that i actually find myself root for the big blue bag of pu the rest of the cast also give commendable performance with young ksun ray a timmy and ms moss deserve special mentions  ray because for one so young he put in a particularly assure turn and moss because she be so bloody yummy this be the third zombie film that i have watch this week the others be the somewhat disappointing planet terror and the rather fun flight of the living dead and to my surprise it be also the best director andrew currie have give fan of the genre something truly original to treasure and be a talent to be watch in the future   out of round up to for imdb  n  an extremely downtoearth well make and acted rodeo western no gussied up star need here a all cast member be regular people tell a real life story about a rodeo hustler and his entourage in the s and s west but hat off particularly to slim pickens for give what i think be his signature performance especially give the fact that he have be a rodeo clown in real life his role go far beyond the mere clown role a he deeply dealt with all the ups and down of the hardnosed rodeo life and the psychological devastation that so frequently surround such a life style he and mr  coburn team up extremely well a partner not only on the circuit itself but also in the real world outside the corral also check out anne archer a coburns native american love interest in the latter part of the movie must have be one of her first roles not a flashy perhaps a junior bonner but equally heart rendering and impacting in it portrayal thanks to the encore western channel for show this true grit of an underrated movie from time to time  n  despite some review be distinctly lukewarm i find the story totally engross and even if some critic have describe the love story a mill and boon so what it be good to see a warm touch story of real love in these cynical time many in the audience be sniff and surreptitiously dab their eye you really believe that the young victoria and albert be passionately fond of each other even though for political reason it be an arranged marriage i do feel though that sir john conroy who be desperate to control the young queen be perhaps play too like a pantomime villain a it be rumour that he be in fact the real father of victoria a a result of an affair with her mother the duchess of kent it would have be interest to explore this theory emily blunt be totally convincing a the young princess trap in the stifle palace with courtier and politician out to manipulate her she illiantly portray the strength of character and determination that eventually make victoria a great queen of england which prosper a never before under her long reign i believe word of mouth recommendation will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful look movie  n  american nightmare be officially tie in my opinion with it pat for the bad movie of all time seven friend oddly resemble the kmart version of the cast of friend gather in a coffee shop to listen to american nightmare a pirate radio show it host by a guy with a beard thats the most exciting aspect of his show chandler monica joey and     oh wait i mean wayne jessie and the rest of the bad oneliner spout gang all take turn reveal their big fear to the beard dj unbeknownst to them a crazed nurse serial killer be listen     crazy nurse then proceed to torture ross and rachel and     wait sorry again     by make their fear come to life these fear include such stunner a voodoo and be go down on by old lady with dentures no really this movie be in a word rotten crazy nurse kill spree lack motivation theres nothing to make the viewer jump the end blow andagainvoodoo if you have absolutely no regard for your loved one rent american nightmare with them if you care for your loved oneseven a little bitgo to your local blockbuster rent all of the copy of american nightmare and hide them in your freezer  n  first off i have to say that i love the book animal farm i read it with my th grade class and it be great we also decide that watch the movie would be beneficial the movie be so disappointing to me the movie cut out some character and miss a lot of the main point of the book it skip around a lot and doesnt explain anything in detail if someone be watch this movie without have first read the book they would be confuse the most disappointing thing in this movie to me be the end the end in the book be the most powerful and in the movie they change it it be suppose to be the pig and men in an alliance and sort of melt together but instead the movie make it seem like the animal be go to rebel against the pig to sum up i dont think that this movie capture the real meaning that orwell portray in his book  n  this movie be extremely boring i only laugh a few time i decide to rent it when i notice william shatners name on the cover it all about this little kid who get pick on all the time by his classmate when wander the street look for old lady to assist he meet a prostitute she take him to a club call the playground where he befriend several pimp when mayor tony gold shatner decide to take over the pimp business lil pimp must lay down for his homies the animation isnt very good in this it look like it be make with macromedia which im sure it be it doesnt suck it just the sort of choppy flash animation that people have get use to over recent year the humor in this be not very good i didnt think any of it be funny  n  i be disgust by this movie no it wasnt because of the graphic sex scene it be because it ruin the image of artemisia gentileschi this movie do not hold much truth about her and her art it show one piece of art work that she do judith beheading holofernese but show that be enter a testimony in the rape trial when she do not paint her first judith for a year after the trial i dont know if you understand this from the movie probably not tassi be not a noble character he rap artemisia it be not love it be rape he do not claim to accept false charge of rape to stop her from suffer while she be torture accord to the rape transcripts he continue to claim that he never carnally knew artemisia aka have sex with while she state over and over again it true i encourage all of you people to go out and find about the real artemisia and see what she be really about dont base all of your knowledge on this fictional movie i encourage you to do some research artemisia really do have interesting story behind her and some amazing art work dont see the movie but find out the true story of artemisia  n  such a joyous world have be create for u in pixars a bug life be immerse in a universe which could only be document this enjoyably on film but more precisely a universe which could only be document through the world of animation for those who have forget what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer    when it in the right hand that be    a bugs life be a warm reminder we walk out of the film with an equallywarm feeling and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only highcalie film productions it be only pixars second animate feature the subgroup of disney make their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three year prior in with their landmark movie toy story it be a movie which defy convention reinvent and eathed new life into animation and define a whole new level of excellence now they return with their sophomore effort which to be honest draw a creep sense of cynicism in u all prior to see the film after all it a film about ant well all walk of the insect and bug world be cover in a bugs life but it be the ant which be the focal point in this film a human be the focal point in drama romance and so on how can such an insignificant specie of animal such a an ant act a the protagonist of a movie let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film surely they jest however we forget that in toy story a bunch of toybox item be able to become the grand most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated hero and villain ever concoct the guy at pixar manage to pull off the same feat and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bug into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin youll probably ever encounter not only be they all entirely amiable and likable    there isnt an unpleasant character in sight even the villain be rivet character    but theyre colourful theyre eclectic and theyre idiosyncratic and the array of character be also gargantuan for lack of a good term only add the rich layer of distinctiveness already plaster onto a bugs life from the beginning we shall start with our main character and our hero his name be flik david foley and his character be rather generic to say the least out of the thousand of faithful and obedient worker ant reside on the lush beautiful ant island he be the one consider the black sheep of the clan a see in the opening moment of the movie when he inadvertently destroy the season harvest with his antics the problem arise in the fact that the ant harvest be for a bunch of greedy grasshopper lead by hopper kevin spacey who be eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ant when they show up to ant island for their annual banquet and see that their offering be go they go insane for lack of a good term hopper offer a proposition to save the ant from total extinction at his pack hand however it a negotiation which be simply impossible to fulfil the cog and clockwork in fliks mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame and he offer to leave ant island in search of some mighty bug warrior who can come to the colony rescue and fight off hopper and the grasshoppers if you think about it a bugs life bear some heavy resemblance to the plot line of akira kurosawa classic seven samurai or the american remake the magnificent seven in which a village of hapless but goodhearted folk be threaten by malevolent and wicked enemy    one lone villagedweller go in search for help in the big city find it and return to the colony to drive off evil in a bugs life the help come in the form of a downandout circus troupe who be mistakenly perceive by flik a warrior in a barroom awl much amusement come out of these scene and much amusement come out of these circus troupe bug among them be an erudite stick insect david hyde pierce a sidesplitting obese german caterpillar by the name of heimlich and a quasifemme fatale ladybug who in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug dennis hopper it exceedingly enjoyable watch these bug onscreen a it be watch the bug and the insect interact onscreen a be the entire movie collectively as ive say much amusement and mirth come out of their character and joyous interaction with one another which give way to a bevy of hilarious line wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situation and overall a dazzling movie what make a bugs life even well be that the film isnt restrict simply to child a many may perceive it to be although child would indeed find more entertainment out of this film    the clich  d kidfriendly situation be a bit more abundant than wed like however it easy to ignore this fault and it incredulously easy to enjoy this film although a bugs life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standard set by it predecessor this be still a superb movie and the start of something promising here pixar have prove that theyre not just a onehit wonder but instead a muchgifted and talented group of film artist in hollywood they raise the bar endlessly and when someone always manage to top their standard it only always by themselves what more be there to say about a bug life other than see it it not quite the best which weve see from the folk at emeryville california but this beat out the lot of it year    and ill be damn if this isnt the best animated feature of      n  what an empty and lack lustre rendition of the classic novel i do wish people would stop mess about with classic when they clearly have no idea of the real intention or point of the original this version be no different i felt that the ralph fiennes version be much bad though a the casting of juliette ioche a kathy have get to be the bad casting decision ever     anyway back to this version it aim to make the story relevant to a contemporary setting and in a musical style it succeed in both but high art it be nit throwaway view for a rainy day maybe     the direction be average and the edit abysmal bad than the old quincy deepak verma do a great turn a hindley and be in fact one of britain waste talent the part of heath be play with great charm and belief and i think that the casting be the strong point of this project although a more talented director would have make well use of the facility he have it clear that he be a director for hire and didnt instill the project with the passion that it deserve  n  my father the hero use to be my favorite movie when i be young it about andre a divorced french man who want to take his beautiful daughter katharine heigl on a vacation hop to get a little closer to her but of course nicole isnt that easy to get along with she just start puberty im guess she be angry and hurt that her father be never there for her and decide to give him a hard time one day at the beach nicole meet handsome ben and she make up a wild story about her and her dad the whole island get involve and the movie turn into a hilarious wild entertain movie i would give my father the hero  n  it be surprising that a production like this get make these day especially for television consider the strong sexual theme and explicit lovemaking scene not to mention lesbianism this have be give superb treatment and direction the set and costume be flawless the direction be stylish and the character be likeable there be a fair amount of humor but it have surprisingly dark interlude the protagonist be really a tragic figure but not devoid of happiness also this production avoid the mistake most films shows make when deal with homosexuality lesbianism the character be very human it seem that to allow people to be comfortable with watch gay and lesbian on tv and movie most show fill it full of cliche and make the character obsess with be gay not so with this in tip the velvet the protagonist be hardly aware of what be lesbian mean the bbc have make some wonderful production in the past and this adventurous period piece only confirm their standard of excellence on all front  n  i just dont get some of the big premise of this episode that miranda be so remarkable and that theres anything so ugly it would make you insane someone here make the remark that maybe it the frequency of the light wave or something rather than it be ugliness miranda be just a jerk the episode be slow inconsistent and way too talky i also dont quite understand why kolos be an ambassador why doesnt the federation just leave the damn medusan be there one part i do like when kolos be speak through spock about the loneliness of the human experience overall i love tos and even at it lame ill always tune in this episode though mmm i wouldnt purchase it except for a used copy under  n  this be one of my all time favorite movie and i would recommend it to anyone on my list of favorite movie mental list mind the only one on par with it be movie such a the lord of the ring series spirit away and fly away home i can really relate to the main character jess at the start of the movie shes a shy girl with a slightly odd background who have a lot more friend who be boy than that be girls she really suck you into her life i also certainly cant fault any of the protagonist act or anyone el in the film the soccer be interest to watch even for someone like me who have no idea of the rule the movie be never bore the romance be really cute and didnt make me blush tooooo hard one thing that really make it though be the indian factor jess parent be indian and there be many colourful indian convention throughout the film provide a very interesting cultural insight as well a everything else the indian people be also hilarious essentially this be a come of age film about choose the path you want and fight for it feel good comedy be become my favorite movie genre thanks to this film theyre funny theyre refreshing and they make you feel good      n  i know that youve already enter this in film festival or at least i think you have i may just be make that up but i think this should get best animate short film in every one bravo i cant wait for the full film i realize that you may not hear this often enough because of the bizarre nature of your animation but hear it now and accept it a the truth kudos my friend okay now im just try to get ten line of text     though i still mean it and here come yet another shoe and i can not stop here yet this be extremely annoying and yet at the same time i have nothing well to do in fact ill probably watch all of your movie in yet another spasmodic jason steele marathon i do have a lot of those r  n  this be probably the first entry in the lance oleary nurse keat detective series in subsequent oleary film he be play by much young actor than guy kibbee a group of relative all play by wellknown character actor gather in an old house on a rainy nite of course to speak to a wealthy relative who go into a coma while they wait for him to recover all sort of mysterious goingson happen include a couple of murders a creepy film worth see  n  this animation have a very simple and straightforward good vs  evil plot and be all about action what set it apart from other animation be how well the human movement be animate it be really beautiful see the flee woman run around on the screen from leave to right and look around her movement be do so well why dont they use this rotoscopic technique more these day it quite effective fire and ice in it prehistoric setting and scarcely dressed woman be clearly devote to show the beautiful damsel in distress in various sexy way her voluptuous body serve a pure eyecandy some may hate this and regard it a yet another moronic male sexual fantasy others include plenty of woman will adore it esthetic quality i for sure do not mind bakshi just love animate lushious voluptuous babe a can also be see in cool world and i dont think he have to apoligize since it pretty much animation for adult but i have also enjoy this animation a a child and i never forget it this one be just special so different from the standard disney or anime fare and for that reason alone well worth the watch since it possibly bakshis finest for those who like animation with lushious woman try space adventure coa a well i give fire and ice out of  n  my rating act suspense character attachment plot character development overall  this show suck very much officially for me csi miami be the best csi ny nd and csi th i dont know in the other csis you get into the episode youre watch but in this one you just cant get into the episode no matter how much you try so in my opinion this show be not worth watch i know people have different opinion and i respect that but for me this csi aint good enough so if you like suspense real acting performance good plot direction character development attachment and you an overall good show i suggest you to watch csi miami  n  i be not a faulkner fan which be consider sacrilegious especially since i grow up near the author hometown however i think this be an excellent movie on par with the quality of the movie to kill a mocking bird if you havent see it buy it anyway it well worth have in your permanent collection tcm recently play the movie a a part of the race on film series i wish theyd play it more often very moving on a side note the folk from oxford mississippi will also enjoy see the footage of the town square a it be back in the s  the courthouse city hall etc theyre all on screen i never know the movie be film there until i notice the familiarity of the building when i saw the arch in the front of city hall i begin to get suspicious look closely at the pennant on chick wall youll see two for ole miss  n  chinese ghost story iii be a totally superfluous sequel to two excellent fantasy film the film deliver the spellcasting special effect that one can expect but fail painfully on all other front the actor all play extremely silly caricature you have to be still in diaper to find their slapstick humor even remotely funny the plot be predictable and the development be sometimes erratic and often slow towards the end the movie begin to resemble old godzilla film include shabby largerthanlife special effect and a well yet another ghost with a godzilla head maybe i would have grin if i be expect camp it be astonish to see what trash fantasy fan have to put up with in this case because somebody think they could squeeze a little extra money out of a successful formula they wont be able to do it again the cash cow be now dead a a dodo  n  i cant stand most reality show and this one be bad than the one with paris hilton and sure it his company but youre fire or youre hire for how many season now after watch the show i wouldnt want to work for the guy with his ego and all and i think watch paint dry have more entertainment valve id love to hear just one person get up and say donald i quit and take some of your money and buy a decent hairdo i see he even try to buy fame in the wrestling wwe i hope he get hurt so i dont have to see his pathetic face anymore it must be sad to want fame so bad and have no talent and make an as of yourself try to buy it id give this show a negative mark if i could but it get a and it doesnt deserve that  n  if i have know this movie be film in the exasperating and queaseinducing dogme style i would never have rent it nevertheless i take a dramamine for the seasickness and give it a shot i last a very very very long forty minute before give up it just bore pretentious twaddle the last french movie i saw be romance and it too be pretty dismal but at least the camera be steady and not eathing down the neck of the character all the time i be baffle at the continue popularity of dogme overseas itll catch on in america about the same time a the next big outeak of leprosy it call dogme because thats the average number of time the actor be poke in the eye by the camera  n  the story and the show be good but it be really depressing and i hate depress movie richard be great he really put on a top notch performance and the girl who play his sister be really awesome and gorgeous seriously i think she be carmen electra until i saw the imdb profile i cant say anything bad about peter galleghar hes one of my favorite actor i love anne rice im currently read the vampire chronicle but im glad i saw the movie before read the book this be a little tooreal for me i prefer lestat and louiss witty little tiff to the struggle of slave eartha kitt be so creepy and after her character do what she do the movie be ruin for me i could barely stand to watch the rest of the show sorry for the ambiguity but i dont want to give anything away sorry but it just not my type of show  n  first let me just comment on what i like about the movie the special effect be fantastic and very rarely do i feel like i be watch a video game there that be the last nice thing i have to say about this film in fact i would just like everyone read this to take note that i cant even put into word how hard it be for me to write this review without swear i have innumerable complaint about the film but four major complaint jump to mind my first major complaint have to do with the incredible cheesiness of the plot twist if you can call it that since most people probably saw it come a mile away where loiss yearold son turn out to be the superpowered child of superman when the cry superchild throw a piano at lexs henchman to save his mother i almost get up and leave the theater singer could have make a much good superman movie without resort to cheap gimmick like a seemingly fragile but latently superpowered illegitimate child it be day since i saw the movie and i still want to vomit my next major complaint have to do with the fact that superman lift a continent make out of kryptonite up into out space it doesnt take comic book guy from the simpson to point out whats wrong with that i dont know how many comic book brian singer have read but when superman be expose to even a small amount of kryptonite he barely have the strength to stay on his foot whoever have the idea to have him fly a large island make out of his great weakness into space have no business be associate with any supermanrelated project ever again the concept be as ridiculous a make a dracula movie where the title character have a stake through his heart and still manage to fly a spaceship make out of garlic into the sun why not just have superman eat kryptonite he can eat it and then ush his teeth with it and then go to sleep in kryptonite pajama thats not any more absurd then have him hoist a continent of kryptonite into space and then fall powerless through the atmosphere without burn up in reentry or splatter all over central park when he hit the ground my third major complaint have to do with the fact that singer slap moviegoer across the face with religious symbolism the entire movie i have to take issue with his characterization of superman a the only son of a godlike jorel send to earth to be a savior jorel wasnt allwise he be just a scientist and he didnt send his son to earth to be a savior he throw him in a rocket and hurriedly fire it into space because his planet be about to explode ill buy the christ allegory if brian singer can show me the part in the bible where god send christ to earth because heaven be about to explode and then radioactive piece of heaven become christ primary weakness furthermore the crucifixion scene where luthor stab superman in the side with a kryptonite spear just make me want to slam my face into a ick until im too aindead to notice the azenly obvious and inappropriate symbolism that will be taint the man of steel for the foreseeable future they might as well rename this movie superman return the passion of the christ and speaking of luthor my last major complaint have to do with singer depiction of lex luthor lex luthor be a shrewd coldhearted business tycoon who be more apt to run for president which he do in the comic than try to destroy the world the man want money and power he want to be in charge not wreck everything yet the luthor we see superman return as well a all the previous superman movie be a wacky theatrical dunce who come up with zany scheme to destroy the world if singer have the slight loyalty to the character instead of the quite awful previous superman movie this film might not be such an unbearable travesty maybe singer next project can be a batman movie where he focus on the interpretation of batman from s tv show zam whap pow to summarize i dont know what i hate more the movie itself or the fact that so many people seem to be give it good review everyone be entitle to their opinion but if you dont hate this movie then your opinion be wrong i sincerely encourage anyone who read this not to see this movie if you havent already dont see it dont buy it when it come out on dvd dont rent it     basically dont contribute any money towards it in any way this movie do not deserve to make any money in fact i think that for every person that see this movie bryan singer should be fin billion dollar if youre a superman fan and you really want to see this movie just bend over and have someone kick you in the ball and youll get the same experience without have to waste hour of your time  n  this be one of the best tv production of a musical ever i have hear the merman cast album the angela lansbury album i have see tyne daly live and ive see the rosalind russell movie countless time i think bette be if not the best then tie with the best she capture not just the avura but also the pathos of mama rise i be never a natalie wood fan so i really enjoy cynthia gibb in what be arguably her best role everything from the costume to the set to the support performance be wonderful the three stripper lead by the alwaysdependable christine ebersole be hard to top there be suppose to be a tv production of mame a few year back with cher but i think bette would be the best bet pun intend for auntie mame  n  i be sorry to say that this film be indeed bad it remind me of a cgrade porn movie with one major difference no porn the story and dialogue need a complete overhaul maybe then the bad act would not have be a noticeable at the very least the pacing should have be pick up while i accept that this have a low budget and the director do a good job visually give what little resource he have he should have spend more time on the story or good yet get someone else to write it many of the action scene be just pointless it be a complete waste of my time  n  be it a perfect movie no it be a weird adaptation from a scifi book and it feature vampire from space naked beauty and the british army efficiency when i first saw this movie i be rather young and all i can remember be the feeling of awe for the movie and mathilda may actually if it werent for this gorgeous lady be naked the whole movie i probably wouldnt have rat it so high but give her sheer magnificence i be now actually consider vote it up lucky for me i get remind of the movie and watch it again now imagine raider of the lose ark or poltergeist special effect splatter unto a rather decent scifi story but with completely over the top performance i still enjoy the movie tremendously as well a mathilda may but it be a mixture of nostalgia compare with the crap movie they make today and actually want more when it ended bottom line if you be a scifi fan you be not allow to miss this movie oh and do i mention mathilda may be young beautiful and naked  n  overall i be rather impressed with the pilot the initial first fifteen minute be worry a it do feel the creator be try to create a science fiction version of the o c but this fear be rectify when a terrorist incident occurs and from here the show step into theme and situation that i very rarely see television tackle bsg dealt with theme such a monotheism existentialism reality death and terrorism but they be primarily subtext there for the viewer to contemplate on or ignore if they so choose here on the other hand these subject be the focus of the show and i personally find myself evoke such work a ghost in the shell and the matrix a reference point while watch and be surprise by how well the theme be be discuss i think if you be a fan of the two i just mention or other films television show which deal with the subject i reference i think you will find at least something here in term of a start point to explain how the situation we know in bsg come about i believe they handle it in a very interesting way i especially like how they explain where the cylons belief in one god come from and the creation of caprica have just enough advanced and contemporary technology throw in to make it appear in the future but not completely alien to u a viewers the only real weak point i notice be the relationship between the greystone parent and the actress who play lacy rand while i like eric stoltz and paula malcomson individually together their scene seem to lack chemistry at this point it could simply be down to develop their character but this be something i think needs work i also find magda apanowicz to be unconvincing in her role this again could be down to experience and time need to develop but throughout the episode her acting appear force and not completely confident based on the pilot i greatly look forward to see where caprica go in the future and hopefully it will touch the greatness that bsg once do  n  im the type of guy who love hood movie from new jack city to baby boy to killa season from the b grade to the hollywood but this movie be something different i be no hater and this movie be kinda enjoyable but some bit be just weird well the act wasnt to good compare to silkk the shocker performance in hot boyz quite good and icet in new jack and svu great the scene where corrupt icet kill the wan na be jamaican dude he say something and light himself on fire burn both icet and the other dude this kill the jamaican however icet be unharmed very similar to ice other movie urban menace which star both of these actor be snoops character be supernatural however after this there be nothing suggest that corrupt be like a demon when mj silkk get stab at first he struggle but after that he fight normally and be stab in the thighwith out blood and when mj confess kill a cop cos the cop be beat up his friend benny be weird benny isnt introduce in this movie and the scene isnt in the film it do hold weight to the fact why corrupt want to kill mj but be still make u scratch your head wen jody write a letter to miss jones character explain what happen to them afterwords doesnt mention what happen other main character mj and lisa the film do show the horror and poverty of the ghettowhich plague the life of latino and black word widewas a good part of the film even though the clip of the project be reused thousand of time and the scene where mile kill the latino other by crash his bike at full speed not wear a helmet and run into my latino others car would of kill him the movie be similar to the film urban menace and half the actor be in both of these movie as well a the production team it be ok tho but me be from poverty i love hood film however if u dont love em like i do dont watch it only thing save me from walk out be it remind me of the first movie i make which be make with dollar and my love of the genre nathaniel purez  n  i be a huge fan of the farcry game huge fan it still hold a place in my top game list of all time the story line be new fresh     a truly illiant foundation to base a movie on     or so i thought     farcry the movie be no less than another director attempt at cash in on a successful game franchise see doom the movie and many more      the video game begin a the player jack carver awakes in a sea side cave after be shoot off his boat by an rpg from an unknown soldier jack then find a communication device where harlan doyle guide him across island shipwreck jungle installation and volcano to find his lady friend valerie constantine all the wile battling mutate super soldier and genetically enhance animals the movie play out very very differently theres a needless min of the movie of backstory before we even get to the boat blow up scene jack then walk onto the beach kill some goon then drive off     nothing like the game     there be no communicator with doyle on the other end     the modified soldier look like albino with singlet on     and there be no mutate monkeylike creature jump out of the bush a part of the farcry game i enjoy allot     there be no sun fill beach scene no aircraft carrier no communication station on huge cliff little reference to any ingame content characters items vehicles in fact no attempt to follow the story line at all the climactic volcano scene from the game be replace with an old industrial building there an end scene     where everyone except krieger live happily ever after     what the i recommend avoid this movie at all cost if you be a gamer you will hate this movie will all your soul it be a movie clearly intend for male so girls stay away     so if your a male year of age have never play farcry and be not disgust by director attempt at port books games to the cinema     then this be for you      n  one of the best ensemble acted film ive ever see there isnt much to the plot but the act incredible you see the character change ever so subtly undr the influence of the rented villa in italy and love and happiness the film cast a mesmerizing spell on you much a the villa do on all the woman truly enchant  n  i havent see this movie in about year but it still haunt me when ask about my favorite film this be the one that i seem to always mention first there be certain film work of art like this film dark city and break the wave that seem to touch a place within you a place so protected and hidden and yet so sensitive that they make a lifelong impression on the viewer not unlike a lifechanging event such a the end of a serious relationship or the death of a friend     this film shake me when i first saw it it leave me with an emotional hangover that last for several day  n  today i write this review in anger at uwe boll and hollywood hollywood have produce movie base on one of the dark day of our nation change everything it change our perception of security it change our understanding of the evil of man and humanity most importantly and devastatingly it change our world however i cant not stress how utterly repulse disillusion and angry i be at the careless blatant ignorance of hollywood seek to make a lucrative profit out of death and destruction this film and those like it be bind to cause controversy amid wordofmouth among moviegoer and critic alike most surely to be echo by the mainstream press hollywood have sink to a new low even low than the lowdown bastard who perpetrate the most barbaric act of savagery and unrelenting cruelty behind it all be uwe boll i be very angry at this movie how dare they disrespect the memory of family of those lose how dare they mock the life of the ave men and woman who risk their life to save those trap in the doomed tower on that fateful day of infamy how dare they try to satirize and at the same time capitalize on a national tragedy in the mist of a mourning and weary post world how     dare     they to those who have the gall to even think of see this morally appal travesty i say this with a heavy heart with all my strength remember think back to that day and ask yourself whether or not you be a sane and moral person think back to that day ask yourself whether or not this film be a disgrace and dishonor to the life lose on that day think back to that day of the outcry of family of loved one think back to that day of the life lose on those two plane think back to the further carnage it cause follow the attacks ask yourself if you have a soul think remember respect the memory of the life lose on by not see this film at all  n  you can not deny that we have an affinity for speed thats why movie like fast and the furious dhoom rempit get make to play to the satisfaction of audience especially local one we live on a tiny island and i can not fathom why for the relative efficiency of the public transportation system most of u want to get into debt by own a set of wheel which come with tax when they reach our shore and the myriad of tax and bill to pay when operate one not only that the high end sport car be once quip by a prominent politician up north that they will never reach fourth gear l they reach the sea and these movie be relatively easy to make hot wheel and hot chick always go down well together in target the required demographic for once those plunge neckline expose uncanny buxom and short skirt accentuate legs two meter long cant compete with the attention give to those beautiful curve that exotic car posse in movie such a these of course there be amongst u ahem those that go for the sexist portrayal of woman a mere sexual object otherwise explain why motor show come with truckloads of model and movie such a these can not do without a leggy model in a frame however they dont warrant the kind of collective orgasmic sigh whenever the four wheeler come on screen even when they do exactly nothing and have their gear into park the guy sit beside me i swear he wet his pant every time his dream car s appear and cream his pant even more when he hear those growl engine moans so there we have it the fan boy who turn up in drove just to watch which of the late cool car get feature in the movie with the fast and the furious franchise the japanese model like the evos and the skyline take centerstage as do the gt here the ford gt take on an incredibly droolworthy facade modification that even im impressed alongside the late model like the ferrari enzos porshe carerra gts koenigsegg ccxs and every car out there that have wing for door but seriously my heart go out to the car each time theyre mercilessly wreck just for entertainment i mean this be perfectly fine high performance model that be at the apex of motor but yet because whoever finance the movie have million to blow they do so because they cantheres no story in redline just excuse to put together a movie full of beauty the car that be that can rip down the tarmac in probably the most boring fashion possible and with the usual shot of pedal always the accelerator mind you tap the ake pedal be tantamount to blasphemy and earn you no respect steer wheel gear shift always shift up and not down all these while have the actor make pretend that theyre the baddest ass with an engine snarling and give each other dirty look not a very tall order for an actor and thats why we get the most woeful performance ever with line that seem to be write by elementary schoolkids the heroine yes it make a statement that girl can drive natasha a very plasticky look nadia bjorlin be one of those million dollar find a girl with model look who dont mind get down on four and immerse in oil who have race pedigree within her and performs with a rock band sing song with lyric that be just plain laughable every line have to do with car and when sing about love just have to string those innuendo like shift gear shafts luicants and go for ride introduce against her wish to illegal racing by a gangsta call infamous eddie griffin she get draw into family squabble involve a leo dicaprio lookalike iraq war veteran and some sleazy lecherous look rich uncle everything else well like i say just serve a an excuse for the movie to go from race to race and it almost always the same a there very limit to what you can do to heighten tension between race car especially when you know the race be rig for narrative reason and can see the race outcome a mile away from the finishing line while fast and furious have quite charismatic actor and i will put my head on the chop block by name paul walker sun kang and of course the star it create vin diesel redline have none just pretty face with lot of air unfortunately it look like a tv movie in it treatment from the get go with a very insipid opening sequence where it one man one car and a minute race against time to get to vegas if not for the car then this movie seriously be a piece of junk with bad act bad line and bad action strictly for the car fan or those who like their movie with countless of bevy beauty who pimp their body without any speaking line  n  im the type of person who always go to horror section when im pick a film so i pick five across the eye i be disgust with this film and think there be no story line and no point that you could enjoy itit make my skin crawl to think that people like to watch film that just encourage violence for the hell of it it be low budget and very rubbish i think i could of do well myself i think that it be the bad film i have ever see in my life and you should not bother to watch it the actor be rubbish the camera be awful the picture be bad and the sound be not up to scratch i think it be a little bit like a cheep rip of off the baler which project and it have not work at all it be foul  n  seven ups have be compare to bullitt for the chase scene but do not come anywhere near match bullitt bullitt have a beginning that build build build when mcqueen leave the seedy hotel get into his mustang which be park under the embarcadero freeway now tear down and notice the charger sit nearbye you know you be about to see something spectacular from that moment on when mcqueen start that car begin the best car chase sequence ever film add to it be a terrific lalo schriffin if i remember correctly sound track this go on for a long time before you actually hear the first tire squeal that shot of mcqueens mustang suddenly appear in bill hickmans rear view mirror be unmatched for visual impact hickmans look of surprise and double take really add to the effect then of course san francisco be unmatched for the setting of car race up and down hill and around bend also bullitt be film in the s when car be still hot mustang gt and dodge charger make for a good set of wheel then two bore smog device laden pontiac in the s seven ups bill hickman be the driver of the bad guy car in both movie i saw him sit at an insider movie preview once on the univeral lot when i be do movie review for a paper they give it a good try in seven ups though with the chase scene seven ups have a few jump over little hill yawn but of course they be not san francisco hill the seven ups chase where they be actually go fast be long than the go fast sequence in bullitt but the scene of a single shotgun blast totally blow the hood off of roy schieders pontiac be the height of absurdity strictly hollywood i would say except that it be film in new york  n  have you ever hear the say that people telegraph their intention well in this movie the character action do more than telegraph future plan they show up at your house drunk and buffet you about the head this could be forgive if the setting have be use well or if the character be more charismatic or nuanced embeth davidtzs character be not mysterious just wooden and kenneth branagh doesnt succeed in convey the ash charm his character probably be write to have the bottom line obvious plot onenote performance unlikeable character and grotesque southern accent employ by british actor  n  night of the living homeless be a fairly strong finish to the first half of season obviously a parody of various zombie movie most notably dawn of the dead this episode parallel the homeless with the live dead a creature who fee and thrive off of spare change rather than ains kyle be blame for the sudden mass outeak of homeless people when he out of the goodness of his heart give a to a homeless man in front of his house more homeless people begin to infiltrate south park until the town be completely overrun with them this be a very strong randy marsh episode a he assume the role of the shotgunwielding leader of the adult who take refuge on the roof of the park county community center but before randy make it to the community center he be accost by hundred of homeless people while hilariously scream i dont have any change unfortunately the refugee end up lose gerald broflofski to the homeless when he try to escape by catch a bus out of town and unwittingly toss away all his change for the bus to distract the homeless people then he become one of them ask everyone for change the boy attempt to find out why there be so many homeless people in south park and find a man who be a director of homeless study they find out that the nearby city of evergreen use to have a similar problem with the homeless so they escape to evergreen to find out what they do to solve the problem unfortunately homeless people eak into the man house and he attempt to take the easy way out by shoot himself however he fail several time a he shoot himself in the jaw in the eye in the chest in the neck in the shoulder scream horribly until he finally die this scene may have be funny have a similar scene not happen in fantastic easter special two week ago meanwhile a member of the refugee discovers that due to the homeless problem the property value have nosedive thus the bank have foreclose on his house make him homeless randy immediately turn on him hold the gun to the man head when the man finally beg the others for a few buck to help him out randy pull the trigger in evergreen the boy find out that the citizen of the town send the homeless to south park and that the passing of homeless from town to town happens all over the country the boy modify a bus that lead the homeless out of south park and take them all the way to santa monica california the zombie movie parallel and the great randy marsh line make this one definitely rewatchable  n  im not sure who decide what category a movie fit into but this movie be not a horror movie a for the story it be fairly interesting but rather slow i be especially disappointed with the end though   spoiler  tell me why on earth do she run over to her uncle home without at least call the detective or the police first she know exactly whats go on at that point plus she have a video tape a proof instead she run over there and start go nut and say i know everything i have proof you didnt expect proof do you then she act surprised when her uncle stand up and start walk over to her a if he go to harm her well duh of course he go to harm you idiot you just tell him you know everything and have proof to expose everything what a dumb end  n  i give this a there be so many plot twist that you can never be sure to root for total mayhem everyone get kill or nearly so i be tire of cross hair and change view i can not give the plot away convolute and insane if i have pay to see this i would demand my money back i wish review be more honest  n  not an easy film to like at first with both the lead character quite unlikeable but luckily the heart and soul of the film be paula sage touch performance which drive the film into uncharted water and transcend the rather awkward storyline this give the film a feeling of real truth and make you think youve see something special  n  i read the book before see the movie and the film be one of the best adaptation out there very true and faithful to the book sean penn and sarandon be amaze robbins be a talented filmaker and i wish he would add more to his repetoire he make the film very haunting and intentionally slowpaced to add depth an especially illiant bit of filmaking be the reflection of the victim appear in the glass of the execution room at the very end  n  docteur petiot star michel serrault be a utal story about a utal man a doctor who heal the sick in occupied france even if their ability to compensate be not there yet he prey on the weak amidst the populace the imagery and cinematography be superb and lend an additional macae feeling to this complex story he be the perfect psychopath seductive and altruistic intelligent and care calculating and murderous a movie certain not to be forget soon by the viewer kudos to mr  serrault for his chilling portrayal  n  i just get this video use and i be watch it last night the acting start out extremely bad heyheytwister but get very good soon after ward the tornado look extremely fake and many of the cgi effect be very dodgy but the scene with the house crack apart and the content inside be blow around and suck out be extremely well do and just about on par with movie like twister the scene of devastation be also extremely well do too the story be very well write and it refreshing to see a movie like this stray away from the same old disaster formula movie of this genre seem to have be stick in for years while this movie have a very weird mix of fx and act quality this merit an a in my book  n  this film be really vile it play on the urban paranoia of the s s and put it into a school context im not say that urban crime wasnt a problem for a lot of people or that school werent arent problem area but this vile piece of exploitation take the biscuit violence be beyond anything realistically imaginable but in this case it not a case of social issue but a white uppermiddle class student use it to turn himself into the crime kingpin of his local high schoiol and of course he know how to play the system do that sound familiar yes this turd be pure violent exploitation a really nasty piece of work it disturb utality dress up a a social comment this belong in the same category a trash like exterminator death wish and so on and so on the only remarkable thing be that michael fox be so oke at the time that he have to do stuff like this  n  what a horrible horrible film the bad collection of cliche i have see in a long time not that i saw much i leave the theatre screaming after about minute in search of a stiff drink to soothe my nerve meryl streep be awful a usual how many hurt and tortured expression can person have aidan quinns talent be a so often totally wasted and who tell gloria estefan she could act try to be polically correct this movie still enforce racial stereotype brave inexperienced lonely music teacher teach underprivilegded kid violin in poor neighbourhood school the kid werent even cute just write in to suit the appalling script aaargh wes craven really make me cringe for once real horror this one  n  motocrossed be fun but it wasnt that great i guess i just didnt understand a lot of the motocross race lingo and there be a lot of that in the film the plot wasnt what i expect from the disney channel preview so that could account for some of my disappointment  n  sixth escapade for freddy krueger in which he have finally manage to kill off virtually every youth in springwood now he want to oaden his horizon and   spoiler   need a family member in order to do it a failure a a horror movie because it simply aint scary at all work well a a dark macae black comedy to tell you the truth freddy krueger have now be strip of all of his ability to chill this viewer too many wisecrack thats for sure the actor arent interest save robert englund a always and an obviously slum yaphet kotto and there be simply far too many visual effect the finale be ok but doesnt provide a many spark a i think one might hope in add a new twist to the familiar dream killer story it provide englund the opportunity to do more nonmakeup scene than ever before there be cameos worth note a joint cameo by thencouple roseanne and tom arnold that be devoid of entertainment value an appropriate appearance by veteran shockrocker alice cooper and a funny cameo by johnny depp that also sort of acknowledges the pop icon that he have become film debut of breckin meyer who play spencer one of the best thing about it be the replaying of key scene from early entry during the closing credits    n  ok im italian but there arent so many italian film like this i think that the plot be very good for of the film but the final be too simple too predictable but it the only little mistake the consequence of love in my opinion have great sequence in particular at the beginning and great soundtrack id like very much the lighting work on it the best thing on it be a great great actor you know if your name be al pacino now everybody would have still be talk about this performance but it only a great theater italian actor call toni servillo yes someone tell me this film and this kind of performance it too slow it so boring so many silence but i think that this components it fantastic it the right way for describe the love story between a very talented young girl the granddaughter of the italian actress anna magnani olivia and the old mysterious man toni one of my favorite italian film  n  if you only see one ernest movie in your life make it this one this be by far the best in the series with it nonstop laugh and clever humor that be suitable for all age the other ernest flick be good too but most people tend to get tire of him quickly not me however  in this movie ernest p  whorrel be assigned jury duty for a murder case the murderer nash just happen to look exactly like our bumble hero ernest mr  nash find this a good opportunity to escape from jail by knock him out switch identity with him and so we get to see how ernest reacts in the slammer a great flick if you havent already see it watch it  n  an idiotic dentist find out that his wife have be unfaithful so no new story line here however the author manage to create a stupid disgusting film if you enjoy watch kid vomit or see a dentist imagining that he be pull all his wife teeth out in a bloody horrortype go see or rent the film if not move on to something else my fair lady anyone  n  the first cube movie be an art movie it set up a world in which all the major archetype of mankind be represent and show how they struggle to make sense of a hostile world that they couldnt understand it be on the nonliteral level a man vs  cruel nature plot where the individual who represent innocence and goodness come through in the end triumph to face a new indefinable world beyond man petty squabble a world where there be no more struggle but peace i rat cube a out of and it a movie that be never mean to have any sequels the second movie hypercube be a massive disappointment some of the idea be kind of cool but in the context of the original movie both the story and the setting make no sense and have no meaning still for be fairly entertain i rat it a out of  the third movie cube zero while ignore the second play like a vastly inferior commercial bmovie rehash of the first sans the symbolism there be no homage or tribute here there be only rip off the same kind of plot with some element idiotically alter like have letter instead of prime number between the cube an idea which show more clearly than anything else that this be a ripoff with absolutely no originality and nothing to say  that we see something from behind the scene mean nothing because the watcher be just part of the big bad experiment the architect of which we hear nothing of and in this movie those who get through to the exit like kazan do at the end of the first movie be just kill where the  bleep  be the sense in that thats just flippin stupid im glad i didnt pay to see this the production value and act in cube zero be not too bad but the story and the idea be so utterly devoid of any inspiration that this movie can only get from me a rating of out of  n  i have just watch this movie on dvd late this morning and be so disappointed that even think it be a good joke for the audience in other word the creator plan to make comedy not drama howsoever at the end i realize that mr  tony giglio be earnest about this movie it a pity because the dialogue be ridiculous the acting be poor and lifeless the story be a fishy tale poor ryan phillippe despite of his effort his character in the movie remain probably his bad performance what to say for jason statham lack of all kind of skill to develop the role which be an imaginary fiction     for this reason i vote  n  i believe shakespeare explain what i just read beautifully me think he the lady doth protest too much the whole thing sound to me a if the author be try to convince himself he sit profane literature writing from the same time period but not connect with the bible a number of time however i can think of at least three reference off the top of my head which lend historical accuracy to event contain in the bible anyone can skew data prove anything they like but it doesnt make it true custom change word definition change over time look at english german where it be very obviously a common root nothing stay the same it always grow and change the bible have many different translation but the king james version be the one ive find to be the best when it come to any kind of research in the king jam version you will notice there be certain word write in italic these word have be add by the translator and can be drop the mean of the entire verse change write from around the time of christ be write without space without punctuation without paragraph without numeric verse these writing look like one long word the translator add all of the above for example how would you read this godisnowhere do you read it a god be nowhere or do you read it a god be now here same string of letter two entirely different meaning this be why many biblical researcher use a lexicon to assist them in translation a it provide a word for word translation from the original arabic greek or heew depend on the language in which the scripture be originally write it also interest to note that when translate into symbolic logic you can prove god exists but you can not prove he doesnt exist in the end i just love listen to people who think they be so smart that they be qualify to judge the almighty talk about ego put soapbox away god bless maegi  n  i presume you be here for damage to your mental circuitry valmike nelson make me watch this     he mention it in his book movie megacheese i ask myself why would mike nelson steer me wrong i now know why the bot never trust mike nelson the music be by john williams which be probably part of his payment to the devil in fact im sure anyone who work on this movie be probably in league with ol slewfoot or be now curse from the executive director down to the guy who run the cater truck outside the studio dont watch     for the love of god     dont watch not even make a copy and show someone else will uncurse you     im doom now i understand this i accept this but save yourself      n  this movie be flippin awful      i want those hour of my life back for god sake stay far away from this awful crumb ball movie at all cost it not worth mention the title but the rating on this movie be pretty generous for a vomit scum movie like this and where do i begin the dumb a   kid in the movie       the zero plot or story     the gardenvariety college frat boyesquire scene of towel slapping or the very bad act teen angst innuendo my god it never end       i remember thinking i would have rather kiss the movie theater floor then sit through this one again but what do you expect most people with the ain power to look up review be not go to be the target audience here at all so go see pirites again or the jet lee one if your debate to yourself look this movie will just cost you your soul your money your energy and your ain cell heed the warning  n  this be a movie that i can watch over and over and never ever get tire of it it have lot of laugh gun action crime good one liner and a decent plot with an over the top donald sutherland in a rather comedic role a an assasain tia carerra look as hot a she ever do and can act too thomas ian griffin be great in this a the lead character max a dea agent diane be the fbi agent play by carerra and john lithgow from frazier on tv play the bad guy livingston the plot center around max and diane try to capture livingston while they fight and argue with each other about who get the money for the respective agency throw into the mix the assassain sutherland who pretty much have all the good one liner this be the perfect crime caper there be the usual love story but play very differently than you would think by carerra and griffith you also have the russian mafia italian mafia and chineese mafia here throw into the mix the film be shoot in boston where you have some great shot and local great photography and music in this film this movie be just the epitome of a crime comedy it have everything that one could ever want check out sutherland toilet in a particular scene very unusual this film be a riot and will make you laugh real hard plus for me  n  if you like to see animal be skin alive their head smash dog throat be crush my men stomp on them then this one be for you but if you be somewhat normal and dont need to see real footage of animal cruelty pas this one up this movie try to shock the viewer and it sure does with the animal snuff at the beginning and the killing of baby in the movie fake at least it be enough to make myself turn it off ive see movie like this before that show slaughterhouse footage btk movie and this kind of footage should not be allow in a horror movie we watch gore and horror because we know it just makeup and special effect so we shouldnt sit down to watch a movie and see the real killing of animal it not what we rent the movie for if anything there should be a large warning label put on these type of garbage movie so people win t be surprise by it a a very hardcore horror fan this one turn my stomach the entire movie cast and crew need their head check  n  another spanish movie about the civil war this time be tell about the story of carol lovely play by d  butant clara lago a little girl which come to live to a little spanish village from new york it be such an initiating trip and soon shell find about the injustice of the human race their stupid fight and conflict their contradictions imanol uribe make his best film since d   xadas contados with such a sober pulse a beautiful photography and a nice script he try not to take part in the conflict he just show u some fact and let u decide ok the fact be explicit enough to make u decide in which band be we in and he take a huge advantage of the presence and the freshness of the young star couple clara lago and juan jos   ballesta a well care production my rate  n  a response to previous comment make by resident of the region where this motion picture be lensed one person suggest that the closing and destruction of the ocean view amusement park lead to a downturn in the surround neighborhood this be simply not true prior to the construction of interstate which bypass the ocean view area the primary route for traffic go through the heart of ocean view once the interstate be complete ocean view rapidly become a ghost town with business close up and an increase in crime this lead to a huge reduction in revenue for the park which also face new competition from nearby busch garden in williamsburg meanwhile in the past few year the city of norfolk have do a remarkable job of foster redevelopment so that the area have become a soughtafter location for construction of highend housing it have also be say that the destruction footage of the roller coaster be use in the film rollercoaster this be also untrue footage be shoot of two coaster car careen off the ride for that film but the actual explosion and collapse be exclusive to death of ocean view park as to the film itself the storyline of a supernatural force in the water adjacent to the park be certainly silly but somewhat typical for bgrade movie of the time with the cast involve there should be no surprise that the scenery be gnaw in almost every scene by the primary actor i dont believe this film be intend to be another citizen kane i believe playboy be experiment with a new nonnude format to determine if this be an area for the company to expand into apparently not a strange force in the water cause strange event in an old amusement park probably sound good at the conference table but prove unmanageable in execution the roller coaster and the rest of the park be destine for the wreck ball anyway let come up with a weird way to justify an explosive demise  for the casual movie viewer this would be a see once and forget about it film except for diana canova fan but for the thousand of people who live in the region and have fond memory of the park this movie be like a walk down memory lane for footage of the park as well a old footage of downtown norfolk the first harborfest and old dominion university even a limited release of this film on dvd would be welcome  n  i be expect a lot from mr amitabh bachans role of sarkar but be disappointed be a ram gopal vermas direction i be not ready for this kind of a movie sarkar be suppose to be a strong character but the movie show that amitabh be too dependent on others power rather than his there be a movie in tamil call nayakan base on the theme of god father and kamala hassan have play the lead the movie be well direct and the power till the end remain in the hand of kamala hassan not his son amitabh bachan seem to be too helpless in the movie and he just accept everything instead of change thing the movie fail to show the strong impact of god father  n  a trio of buddy sergeant all in the british army carouse awl their way across imperial india intensely loyal to each other they meet their great most deadly challenge when they encounter the resurgence of a hideous cult it demented implacable guru now they must rely on the lowly servant of the regiment the water carrier gunga din to save score of the queen soldier from certain massacre based more on the three musketeer than kipling classic poem this be a wonderful adventure epic a worthy entry in hollywood golden year of fill with suspense humor while keep the romantic interlude to the bare minimum it grip the interest of the viewer and hold it right up to the sentimental conclusion it be practically fruitless to discuss the performance nuance of the three star cary grant victor mclaglen douglas fairbanks jr  a they be really all third of a single organism inseparable and to all intent purpose indistinguishable however this diminish nothing of the great fun in simply watch them have a glorious time it interesting to note parenthetically that mclaglen boast of a distinguished world war one military career fairbanks would have a sterling record in world war two mostly in clandestine affair earn himself no few than honorary knighthood after the conflict while grant reportedly work undercover for british intelligence keep an eye on hollywood nazi sympathizer the real acting laurel here should go to sam jaffe hearteaking in the title role he infuse the humble man with radiant dignity enormous courage make the last line of kipling poem ring true he be unforgettable montague love be properly stalwart a the regimental major whilst eduardo ciannelli be evil incarnate a the thuggee guru the rest of the cast joan fontaine robert coote lumsden hare be effective but have little to do movie maven will recognize cecil kellaway in the tiny role of miss fontaines father the film pick it villain well the demonic thuggee cult worshiper of the hideous bloodsoaked kali hindu goddess of destruction be the bane of indian life for century ritualistically strangle up to victim a year in the british military in cooperation with a number of princely state succeed in ultimately suppress the religion henceforth it would remain the stuff of novel nightmare  n  this movie pretty much suck im in the army and the soldier depict in this movie be horrible if your in the military and you see this movie youll laugh and be upset the entire movie because of the way they act a a squad it be ridiculous they act like a bunch of normal people with army uniform on not know what to do it be a pretty gory movie id have to say the least there be a couple scene where they try to make you jump id recommend see it if you be bore and want to see a violent gory movie it will be a good movie also if your not in the military i also would have to say i like the first one good than this one  n  if you watch pulp fiction dont see this movie this movie be not funny this be the bad parody movie ever this be a poor attempt of parody films the cast be bad the film be bad this be one of the bad picture ever made i do not recommend plump fiction i prefer the original pulp fiction by the great quentin tarantino this be one of the bad parody film ever made plump fiction be not a good movie it be not funny it be so dumb and vulgar  n  i go to see passion of mind because i usually get a kick out of the genre of alternate reality romance i e slide door me myself i etc but this be the bad one ive ever see i have to force myself to sit through it i didnt even stay through the credit which be unheard of for me the magical realism be completely miss because demi moore be grim and the lover she be twotiming be guy who usually play villain though each be kind of sexy and appealing there be actually a psychological explanation provide for the dual live with a distasteful frisson of the elektra complex maybe the magic shouldnt be explain for this genre to work originally write     n  i think that rotj be clearly the best out of the three star war movie i find it surprising that rotj be consider the weak installment in the trilogy by many who have vote to me it seem like rotj be the best because it have the most profound plot the most suspense surprise most emotional especially the end and definitely the most episodic movie i personally like the empire strike back a lot also but i think it be slightly less good than than rotj since it be slowermoving be not a episodic and i just do not feel as much suspense or emotion a i do with the third movie it also seem like to me that after read these surprising review that the reason people cite for rotj be an inferior film to the other two be just plain ludicrous and be insignificant reason compare to the sheer excellence of the film a a whole i have hear many strange reason such a a because yoda die b because bobba fett die c because small ewoks defeat a band of stormtroopers d because darth vader be revealedi would like to debunk each of these reason because i believe that they miss the point completely first off who care if bobba fett die if george lucas want him to die then he want him to die dont get me wrong i be fan of bobba fett but he make a few cameo appearance and it be not lucas intention to make him a central character in the film that star war fan make him out to be his name be not even mention anywhere in the movie     you have to go to the credit to find out bobba fetts name judge rotj because a minor character die be a bit much i think     secondly many fan do not like yoda die sure it be a momentous period in the movie i be not happy to see him die either but it make the movie more realistic all the good guy cant stay alive in a realistic movie you know otherwise if all the good guy live and all the bad guy die this movie would have be tantamount to a cheesy saturday morning cartoon another aspect to this point about people not like yodas death   well nobody complain when darth vader strike down obi wan kenobi in a new hope many consider a new hope to be the best of the trilogy why be obi wan death okay but yodas not     hmmmmmmmmmmmm     another reason i just can not believe be even state be because people find cute ewoks overpower stormtroopers to be impossible that be utterly ridiculous i can not believe this one first off the ewoks be in their native planet endor so they be cognizant of their home terrain since they live there if you watch the movie carefully many of the tactic the ewoks use in defeat the stormtroopers be through excellent use of their home field advantage since you live in the forest all your life i hope you would have learn to use it to your advantage they have swing vine rope log set up to trip those walker and other trap the stormtroopers be highly disadvantage because they be outnumber and not aware of the advantage of the forest the only thing they have be their blaster to add it be not like the ewoks be battle the stormtroopers themselves they be heavily assist by the band of rebel in that conquest i think that if the stormtroopers be to have defeat a combination of the star war heros the band of rebel as well a the huge clan of ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain that would have be a great upset lastly if this scene be still unbelievable to you   how about in empire strike back or in a new hope where there be several scene of a group consist of just han solo chewbacca and the princess be shoot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blaster miss while the hero be in full view and not only that the hero of course always hit the stormtroopers with their blaster the trooper must have very very bad aim then at least in empire strike back the battle of endor be much more believable since you have two army pit each other not hero against a legion of stormtroopers dont believe me check out the battle at cloud city when our hero be escape landos base or when our hero be rescue princess leia and be shoot at somehow they miss a han solo and luke be try to exit the death star the last reason that i care to discuss others be just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here be that people do not like darth vader be reveal well in many way that be a major part of the plot in the movie luke be try to find whether or not darth vader be his father annakin skywalker it would have be disappoint if the movie have end without luke get to see his father face because it make it complete by annakins revelation it symbolize the transition darth vader underwent from be possess by the dark side in his helmet and to the good person he be annakin skywalker by remove the helmet the point be that annakin die convert to the light side again and that be what the meaning of the helmet removal scene be about in fact thats be what i would have do in that scene too if i be luke father     isnt that what you would have do if you want to see your son with your own eye before you die and not in a mechanized helmet on another note i think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people be that the sequel must be bad even if it be well that precede movie be another reason that rotj do not get a many accolade a it deserve i never go into a film with that deception in mind i always try to go into a film with the attitude that well it might be good or bad that the original    but i can not know for sure   let see that way i go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into think that a clearly superior film be not as good a it really was i be not sure who criticize these movie but i have ask many college student and adult about which be their favorite star war movie and they all tell me except for one person that say that a new hope be their favorite that it be rotj i believe that the result on these poll be appal and quite misleading bottom line the return of the jedi be the best of the trilogy this movie be the only one of the three that keep me rivet all throughout it minute there be not a moment of boredom because each scene be either suspenseful excite surprising or all of the above for example the emotional light saber battle between luke and his father in rotj be good than the one in the empire strike back any day finally i hope people go see the phantom menace with an open mind because if fan start look for nitpicky insignificant detail or see it as just another sequel to trash the movie such a this movie stink because luke be not in it then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like rotj suffer unfortunately  n  crossfire remain one of the best hollywood message movie because unlike the admirably intentioned gentleman agreement which it beat to theatre by a few month it choose to send it message via the form an excellent noir thriller rather than have an outrage star constantly say it because im jewish isnt it it much easy to get the message that hate be like a loaded gun across when the dead body be actual rather than metaphorical somewhat shamefully the ief featurette on the warner dvd doesnt mention that novelist richard brook disown the film over the shift from a homophobic murder to an antisemitic one but it interesting to note that while the victim be kill primarily because he be jewish there little doubt in sam levenes performance that the character be in fact also gay    not a mincing caricature but theres definitely a two lose soul aspect to his scene with george cooper confuse soldier there not much of a mystery to who the murderer be even though the killing be carry out in classic noir shadow the body language of the killer be instantly recognisable but then the film have it character drift to the same conclusion before the halfway point the tension come from prove it and save the fall guy theres an element of ealing film to the gang of soldier team together to get their buddy out of a fix you could almost see that aspect a a blueprint for hue and cry but the atmosphere be pure rko noir set over one long swelter night the film have a great look fill with deep dark black and shadow bear a much out of economy a style it cut back on lighting time and allow director edward dmytryk more time to work with the actor and the excellent cast make the most of the fine script a laidback but quietly charismatic robert mitchum robert young maigretlike detective gloria grahame tramp and the perpetually creepy paul kelly a her compulsive liar admirer a guy who try on story the way other people try on tie but the lasting impression be of robert ryans excellent performance a a guy who could do with a good leave alone a he do his best to help the wrongly accuse man all the way to death row a big surprise hit in a a reward dmytryk and producer adrian scott find themselves investigate by the huac which itself have a notable tendency to target jew so much for crusading    n  this movie basically be a very well make production and give a good impression of a war situation and it effect on those involve it always interesting to see the story from the other side for a change this movie concentrate on a group of german soldier who after fight in the north africa campaign be send to stalingrad russia where one of the most notorious and bloody battle of ww ii be be fought its interest to see the other side of this battle since we mainly just always see the german simply a the villain in this movie those villain be give an humane face and voice and it sort of make you realize that the only true enemy in war be war itself and not necessarily those who youre fight against at first it kind of hard to concentrate on the movie because you always just have in the back of your mind that the german be the evil villain but of course you get accustom to it quickly and you soon adapt the german a the main character of the movie and you even start to care and be interested in them the way this story be tell isnt however the best it hard to keep track of the story at time a it jump from the one sequence and location to the other the movie isnt always logic in it storytelling and feature a bit too many sequence that remain too vague it also be most of the time pretty hard to keep the character apart and see who be who it doesnt always make this movie an easy on to watch but than again on the other hand there be plenty enough sequence and moment present in this movie to make it worthwhile and an interesting one just not the most coherent one around in that regard hollywood movie be always good than european movies the production value be high and feature some good look set and location though the movie wasnt even shoot in russia itself it help to create a good war time situation atmosphere the character be mostly interesting although perhaps a tad bit formulaic but i dont know for some reason formulaic character always work out fine in war movie and strenghtens the drama and realism it also help that theyre be play by well cast actor all of the actor arent the best known actor around thomas kretschmann be also at the time still a fairly unknown actor but each of them fit their role well and give it character an unique face and personality all in all not the best or most consistent ww ii drama around but definitely worth a look due to it original approach of the german side of the battle of stalingrad and it good production values    n  so i rent this from netflix because somebody give me roger eberts book i hat hat hat this movie and he give this one a rare zerostar rating in the book and say at the end of his original review mad dog time should be cut up to provide free ukulele pick for the poor so i figure from ebert say that i would see if it be really as bad a he say it be i know most society say not to listen to critic and to judge for yourself but i could not express how much i hat this piece of junk like ebert do and never since eberts review of rob reiners north where he say he hat that movie ten time have i ever hear such a illiant hatred movie review here we have richard dreyfus a a gangster which i dont think it would be terrible to see dreyfuss a a gangster if the screenplay for this movie be write well but above all the other thing that be awful about this movie i can certainly tell you the script be not write well at all while the movie start off with jeff goldblum say that he enjoy watch dreyfusss girlfriend while dreyfus be at a criminal hospital the movie start off with some decent dialog after the opening credit but after that first or minute the other minute just consists of dumb character talk pointless garbage for second then someone get shot then there be a whole bunch of joke about dreyfus be mentally ill  haha not funny then we get an unpleasant and unfunny scene parody frank sinatra my way sang by gaiel byrne apparently to insult dreyfus of course because the screenplay be write on the level of a sixth grader dreyfus shoot byrne over five time and byrne just will not die be we a the audience suppose to even care or find that mildly funny i can certainly tell you i do not care or find that funny not only be i disappoint in dreyfus who i admire much a an actor for produce and star in this tripe but i be also extremely disappointed in jeff goldblum because this be release the same year that independence day be the top grossing film of the year and ultimately one of the most successful film in history do goldblum feel that independence day would be a flop and then just take the next role that be offer to him to make some money if independence day be a bomb what do an oscar winner and the star of two of the big money make film in history find remotely enjoyable about this the opening sequence of mad dog time say that the movie be set on another planet i only wish now that i have waste minute watch this trash that it would have stay and open in theater on the planet where it supposedly take place so that way everyone on this planet would never here of this ridiculous waste of minute out of my life that i will never get back ebert say the movie should have be cut up be not good enough i be afraid every copy of mad dog time should have gasoline pour all over it and be light on fire i have yet to top a bad movie i have ever see because this one have win it honor a the bad movie ever  n  what a boring film to sum it all up it be basically just nana patekar beat up his daughterinlaw karisma kapoor while she try to flee from the village with her son can someone say bore the concept wasnt too bad but it be poorly execute the canadian locale and some of the village scene be nicely shot however overall the cinematography come up short the story could have be great but the movie just seem to drag on there be only so much stupidity a person can take let alone three bloody hour of it the best part of the whole movie be the song ishq kamina and that be only five minute long other than that this movie be a piece of crap  n  rant start i didnt want to believe them at first but i guess this be what people be talk about when they say south korean cinema have peak and may even be go downhill after the surprisingly fun and move monster movie gwoemul aka the host of which actually succeed in make a sharp satire out of a bmovie genre successive korean blockbuster have become more and more generic even though their budget mainly spend on special effect have become more and more fantastic do south korean moviemakers really want to squander all the audience and investor goodwill which their industry have build up since the eakout film shiri swiri by make a whole series of big budget mediocre movie like mainland china do rant end the only reason i can fathom for make this movie be to dupe the investor into finance the most detailed and fluid digital animation of a korean  east asianstyled dragon i have see to date for the final scene now if they have introduce that dragon at the beginning and give it more personality and purpose like in the dragonheart the movie might have have a few more redeeming quality other than have lot of digitally animate dragon remember dungeon dragon in hasnt anyone learnt that the trick be not how much special effect you use but how well you use it i hope there be more and good korean legend they can use because they have just kill a lot of international interest in korean dragon legends with the way they film this one in short i agree with all the negative review go before and wonder how korean felt about have their folk anthem arirang be play at the very end a a creature feature i would have give it at least star out of if the special effect or action sequence have be worth it but ive see many video game with good camera work and script just less dragon  n  a a native chinese i can not accept this kind of idea that some people must die for a good world i say well world because it be a lie that chinese people have be indoctrinate for thousand year i guess most western audience may dont know qin shihuang mean the first emperor the king in this film be the most notorious tyrant in ancient china the tianxia chinese word be speak by the king mean the land and the people speak from his mouth be totally lie from then on one after another all the king in ancient china speak the same thing but very few of them do a what they said another fact be qin shihuangs empire only last about twenty year before it be destroy by people well i do like the beautiful scene of this movie but it can not make me accept the idea that people should die for a tyrant  n  this have a great cast with bigname star like tyrone power henry fonda randolph scott nancy kelly henry hull and brian donlevey and a bunch more lesserbutknown name with short role it also have technicolor one of the few movie make with it in  now the bad news          regrettably i cant say much positive for the story it portray the james boys in a totally positive light      and hollywood have do that ever since why these criminal be always show to be the good guy be beyond me this film glamorize them and make their enemy the railroad people into vicious human be the latter be exaggerate so much it be preposterous well thats the film world for you evil be good good be bad hey hollywood heres a news flash the james boy be criminal really look it up  n  i remember watch this series avidly every saturday even it be the highlight of the week i love everything about it the location the costume the actor and the wonderful music by clannad i still have their legend album i love the way they solve the problem of michael praed leave by create another robin this time the earl of huntingdon i believe there be legend of several robin in medieval time another thing i love be the fact that it be fill with young actor im sure robin and his men would have young after all people didnt live that long in those day other robin always look too old kevin costner with his ridiculous accent look like robin granddad the only sad thing be the end it a shame they couldnt at least have do a one off special to tie up all the loose end and give it a happier end  n  i dont normally write review but this film be special i couldnt turn it off i dont believe ive ever see a bad movie but there i sit watch it be like a horrible car wreck with blood flow all over the highway it be disgust but i couldnt turn away where do i start the movie seem to think it a sport thriller but it so utterly ridiculous it can only be a comedy but it not funny not even in a dumb silly way it like watch your cousin try to act out a skit on family gettogethers it painful to watch but at least it only for a minute or two second string go on for over an hour whoever be involve with make this movie should not work again the write directing acting and everything be just terrible the problem be i cant describe how bad it be you just have to see it and im sure this will never be show again so unless you saw it youre out of luck i mean it be almost worth see just for the fact that it give me some appreciation for every other bad film ive see over my lifetime and for every film i see in the future that i cant stand i will think to myself well at least it wasnt bad a the second string  n  few would argue that master animation director hayao miyazaki be one of the few to hold this ability     no too many be focus on john lassiters amaze ability to steal other movie plot turn them into pretty puppet show and then be laud a a genius but i digress miyazaki have give u film after film that deal with important mature issue usually ecologically theme and have an intelligent script that even the most jaded viewer who would normally despise any film that be animate could thoroughly enjoy if give the chance still miyazaki almost never forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these movie children that say i be at a loss to think of another filmmaker with this ability where else be you go to have a film where a three year old my nephew link will sit still throughout the move enthral a year old my niece amber love it all her own and able to appreciate the star power of frankie jonas and noah cyrus a year old my nephew aaron who review be of course it be good everything miyazakisan do be good a year old animation fan ought to tear by the powerful directing and gorgeous animation er that would be me and a year old woman my mother able to connect with the mother character and im bet the old chara too and love the cuteness of the child characters and that be what i respect most about miyazakisan he seem to speak to his audience in a completely different way than the average filmmaker on the surface ponyo could be see a a simple story about a little fishgirl who get a taste of the human world and want to join it and the friend she make there a little boy name soske somewhat like the little mermaid but there be an entire different level at play here true to form miyazaki populate his film with intensely strong female character ponyos mother soskes mother the old lady in a nursing home be all genuine character with mind of their own and extremely strong willed but the girl who take the cake be ponyo herself once she decide that she like the human world she simply use her own will to achieve her dream her father be try to keep her innocent and keep her a magical fish but young ponyo know what she want and become human out of simply her own determination once human she team up with her friend soske whom she love very much although maybe not as much a ham soske be ask to be the man of the house at age five when his mother lisa decide she have to help the people at the rest home where she work during a typhoon that have be inadvertently cause by ponyo on her quest to become human frankie jonas yes he relate to the jonas others can we just get past that please give perhaps the best performance in the film a young soske which be good since he have the most line his character be also strong will but also very respectful and friendly characteristic youre not likely to find in a child character on this side of the pacific in the end ponyos father fujimoto must cope with his daughter decision and his estranges wifes wish to allow her to be human he hop that ponyo and soske will remember him fondly and once again miyazaki refuse to allow a character to become the stereotypical bad guy although miyazaki have for some reason receive some criticism for this it be honestly what make his movie magical and yet relatable no one in real life be completely a bad person all human be various shade of gray and that be exactly what miyazaki do with his character and then theres the animation itself in a time when cgi would certainly have help with the copious amount of effect shot in this film especially the water miyazaki have choose to incorporate no cgi whatsoever certainly the hand drawn animation be color by digital mean but every film in this be handdrawn and i for one be extremely grateful for that the character animation be extremely fluid and there even appear to be some lipsync go on quite unusual for an anime film the background seem to be render with colored pencil and have an effect all it own on the audience this be what animation use to look like and what it should look like in the end i find ponyo to be thoroughly enjoyable certainly not miyazakis best in my opinion that honor be still hold by kikis delivery service but still a star fun movie for the entire family  n  attractive marjorie farrah fawcett live in fear after be accost by a lone biker she be mortally shake with the fact her attacker know her address a expect joe james russo the attacker force his way into marjories home and subject her to humiliate terror bruise and bloody marjorie manages to get an upper hand on her attacker knock the living daylight out of the jerk and render him helpless thanks to wasp spray in his eye and throat hog tie and batter himself joe try to explain himself to marjories roommate diana scarwid and alfrie woodard when they get home there be almost a hint of mercy but it be not come from marjorie should she continue to render her own punishment violence sexual abuse and rough language make for an r rating fawcett really get away from the ditsy roles that would forever stain her career kudos to director robert m  young  n  i find it sad that just because edward norton do not want to be in the film or have anything to do with it people automatically think the movie suck without even watch it or give it a chance i really hope norton do not do this he be a fine actor and all but he scar people away from a decent movie i find it entertain it wasnt mind blowing or anything with crazy special effect but it be not a bad it be fun to watch but yea definitely not a bad horrible movie    n  i watch this movie on tv last night hop for a realistic account of what could happen if there be an outeak of some highly transmittable disease i be disappointed and i think the movie be garbage it do not seem real to me some of the acting be awful in particular that of the doctor she be about the bad ive see the whole thing play like a cnn bad case scenario even the obligatory disaster movie human relation bit didnt seem sincere i have see some disaster movie in particular those weather one which be actually so bad they be amuse this one be almost a bad but it be not even amuse it be tedious and boring dont bother with this one  n  for those out there that like to think of themselves a reasonably intelligent human being who love film have good attention to detail and enjoy indie movie with funny smartly write dialogue then this be a film for you for those with a poor attention span high expectation and no ains   well   um   you may get bore and find thing drag at times this be a charming modest and well paced movie with the actor bestow a real sense of depth and warmth to their role i chuckle to myself pretty much the whole way through  this film be a little gem  n  the great caruso be the big hit in the world in and oke all box office record at radio city music hall in a year when most movergoers be stayathomes watch their new motorola television almost all recent box office figure be false because they fail to adjust inflation obviously todays movie will dominate in it cost c to at radio city c to c first run at loews palace in washington dc or c to c in neighborhood run what count be the number of people respond to the picture not unadjusted box office medium spin the genius of the great caruso be that the filmmaker take most of the actual life of enrico caruso really not a great story anyway and throw it in the trash instead of the movie focus be on the music thus mgm give u the best living opera singer mario lanza do the music of the bestever historic opera singer enrico caruso the result be a wonderful movie too bad lanza would throw his life and career away on overeat too fat to play the student prince edmund purdom take his place with lanzas voice dub in and with the formerly handsome and notfat lanza picture in the advertising if you want to see the great caruso it almost always on ebay for or less dont be put off by the low price a it reflect only the easy availability of copy not the quality of the movie  n  i attend an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from kevin costner and ashton kutcher both have deliver less than memorable performance film while the underlie general storyline be somewhat familiar this film be excellent both costner and kutcher deliver powerful performance play extremely well off each other the human frailty and strength of their respective character be incredibly play by both the scene when costner confront kutcher with the personal reason why kutcher join the coast guard rescue elite be the film most unforgettable emotional moment the specific storyline be an education in itself depict the personal sacrifice and demand physical train the elite coast guard rescuer must go through in preparation of their only job responsibility     to save life at sea the special effect of the rescue scene be extremely realistic and wow     i havent see such angry sea since the perfect storm costar clancy brown hbos carnivale great to see him again play the captain of the coast guard kodiak alaska base in a strong convincing role a a leader with the prerequisite and necessary ice water in his vein the film wonderfully and finally give long overdue exposure and respect to the coast guard it have the audience applaud at the end  n  i be not weapon expert but even i can see difference between u s  army riffle in wwi and wwii in movie we can see private arm with m garand invent in year not authentic springfield aka silent death who privates use until wwii difference m can load time more ammunition and time more fire rate m be semi automatic springfield require reload after every shot little difference german army uniform have borrow from year too especially helmets german helmet until end of wwi have significant pike on top we can not see even one in movie and if we make little additional search in archive how much truthful be this true story i be surprise how much truthful can be film director in a pursuit of cheap propagation  n  do you ever wonder what be the bad movie ever make stop wondering im tell you michael be it it be not heartwarming entertain or travolta at his best it just suck if i have kid i would let them watch deep throat before michael a soldout john travolta a washedup and bald william hurt and an about to die any time now jean stapleton highlight this turd of a film but wait     youll get to hear andie mcdowell sing yeah hollywood really s  t all over u with this one  n  the film begin with wheeler sneak into the apartment of his girlfriend her aunt edna may olivera person too talented for this film didnt like wheelera sentiment i can easily relate to the aunt decide to take this bland young lady aoad to get her away from wheeler they leave and wheeler invest in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promise to make him their king at about the same time woolsey be in the same small mythical kingdom and he be make king so when wheeler arrive it be up to the boy to fight it out but they refuse because they be already friendswhich greatly disappoint the people a kill and replace king be a national pastime i be a huge fan of comedy from the golden age of hollywoodthe silent era through the s  i have see and review hundred if not thousand of these film and yet despite my love and appreciation for these film i have never be able to understand the appeal of wheeler and woolseythe only comedy team that might be as bad a the ritz brother despite be very successful in their short career in hollywood cut short due to the early death of robert woolsey i cant help but notice that practically every other successful team do the same basic idea but much good for example there be many element of this film reminiscent of the marx brother film duck soup yet crack nut never make me laugh and duck soup be a silly and highly enjoyable romp at time woolsey talk a bit like groucho but his joke never have punchlines that even remotely be funny in fact he just seem to prattle pointlessly his only funny quality be that he look goofysurely not enough reason to put him on film additionally wheeler have the comedic appeal of a piece of cheesea piece of cheese that sing very poorly a missed opportunity be the old vaudeville routine later popularize by abbott and costello a who on first which be do in this film but it lack any spark of wit or timing in fact soon after they start their spiel they just end the routineso prematurely that you be leave frustrated i know that who on first have be around for many year and use by many team but i really want to see wheeler and woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twist once again i have find yet another subpar film by this duo while i must admit that i like a few of their film mildly such a silly billy and the rainmakerswhich i actually give s to on imdb this one be a major endurance test to completesomething that i find happen all too often when i view the film of wheeler and woolsey where be all the humor  n  i be really hop that this would be a funny show give all the hype and the clever preview clip and talk about hype i even hear an interview with the show creator on the bbc world today a show that be oadcast all over the world unfortunately this show doesnt even come close to deliver all of the joke be obvious the kind that sound kind of funny the first time you hear them but after that seem lame and they be not give any new treatment or twist all of the character be onedimensional the acting be well mediocre im be nice it the classic cbc recipe one that always fails if youre muslim i think you would have to be stupid to believe any of the white character and if youre white youd probably be offend a little by the fact that almost all of the white character be portray a either bigoted ignorant or both not that make fun of white people be a problem most of the good comedy be root in that it only a problem when it isnt funny a in this show canada be burst with funny people so many that we export them to hollywood on a regular basis so how come the producer of this show couldnt find any  n  first of all mexican werewolf in texas be not a werewolf movie this title be bullcrap the story be actually about a chupacaa that kill all the local villager in the little town of furlough in texas i suppose the distributor rename the original title so that it would make some extra buck or something and i guess it actually work because thats the reason why i buy this piece of crap it sound so stupid anyway the movie isnt any good actually it bloody awful but i didnt expect anything else when i buy it it a low budget horror movie with a chupacaa monster if you enjoy low budget horror with bad dialog actor and some gore then you should check into this movie but i must warn you this movie be really baaaaaaad this movie have some of the bad act i have ever see the actor try to hard and t it get completely ridiculous they almost never say a line in a normal way they always have this completely wrong tone about just everything they say it so stupid it almost look like a freakin parody it like they shoot each scene only one single time and be happy about it the bad of them all be the blond girl which be suppose to play a bimbo shes the bad of them all i have never see an actor as bad a her and ive see pteradactyl even when her boyfriend die she cant stop be a bimbo about it i hate her some of the shot in this movie be actually quite good the one that where shot in the daytime be all pretty decent for a low budget project but most of the movie be shoot in the night when the chupacaa strike and the lighting be way too dark the gore scene be few and short but really grizzly and violent the effect be pretty hilarious really but thats the way i like it the chupacaa look pretty mess up and it easy to see that it a guy in suit overall this movie should only be watch by extreme fan of low budget flick and it very important to not watch this alone because you will probably be bore to death i recommend watch this flick with your friend and some beer  n  this movie be so godawful that it be literally a chore to watch i want to eject it from my vcr and throw it across the room but keep think foolishly that it would eventually get funny and then everything would be all right you lose we win yay this movie should be require view for anyone who even once entertain the thought that jackie mason be funny after that beat them ove the head with this movie until the tape crack and if youre even consider rent this turd or bad yet have i have one thing to ask of you didnt you even look at the cover i mean with crap like this you can tell with just a glance how bad it be oy vey this movie suck  n  the symbolic use of object form edit the position of character in the scene     these be all use with such joyous abandon by hitchcock that you can really see what a fertile genius he have the way the wife move from one corner of the ring to the other a the fight progress the editing when the wedding ring be place on her finger     while these may seem a bit obvious by today standard in the silent era they speak volume about the story without a word be speak even the title have a least four meaning that i can see the box ring the wedding ring the acelet the lover buy and the love triangle at the heart of the story  n  i find this movie to be very good in all area the acting be illiant from all character especially ms stone and morissey tramells character just get smart and more psychologically twist by the minute the plot be interest even though this movie be more for the mind playing between the main character and how catherine continue her write with new way and twist for her novel the setting be also fabulous and the whole atmosphere of the movie be that mysteriousthriller like masterpiece go see this film now it deserve good than what it get from the audience which be mislead by some faulty terrible review about the movie before it even start       you wont regret itif you go see it      n  rather like paul newman and steve mcqueen with their racing car movie this have all the appearance of a jolly project for robert redford a he get to ski up hill and down dale in the alpine sunshine the story be as light a powdered snow with redford smalltown boy david chappellet what kind of lead name be that who with his eye on the prize of olympic glory get up the nose of in no particular order his coach father and teammate woman be a mere sideshow in his insular world a evidence by a fairly distasteful pickup scene with an old girlfriend in his hometown and then his selfishly petulant pursuit of heaven above a freethinking independent woman play by camilla sparv the skiing sequence be fine with some good stuntwork involve numerous bump and scrape on the piste but their effectiveness be dim by our subsequent familiarity with top tv coverage of ski event down to the present day plus im not convince that the winter olympics have the same mass identification with the general public a the summer game so that when redford eventually win his gold medal in the final reel i couldnt really be that excited for him one way or another of the actor redford best profile forward doesnt need to do much and indeed doesnt while gene hackman do well with equally meagre material m sparv do well a the chief female interest well who treat redford the way hes doubtless treat every other woman in his chauvinistic way in truth though there a lack of dramatic tension throughout for which the action sequence dont fully compensate and you dont care a fig for any of the lead character one of those film where the actor probably enjoy make it more than the viewer do watch it  n  i would recommend this film to anyone who be search for a relaxing funfilled thoughtprovoking movie the absence of sex vulgarity and violence make for a most pleasant evening i especially enjoy the buffalo scene but thats probably because i live a short distance from there even so this film could have be produce in any city it the theme thats so important here im just grateful that manna from heaven drop down on u try it     youll like it  n  this be an art film that be either make in or the national film preservation foundation say and imdb say regardless of the exact date the film definitely appear to be very indicative of this general time periodwith some camerawork and pop art stylings that be pure late searly s the film consists of three simple image that be distort use different weird camera trick these distort image be accompany by music and there be absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort this be obviously intend a almost like a form of performance art and like most performance art it interesting at first but quickly become tiresome the film to put it even more bluntly be a total bore and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who make the film their family and friend and perhaps a few people just too hip and with it to be understand by u mortal  n  i read the book and saw the movie both excellent the movie be diamond among coal during this era liebman and selby dominate the screen and communicate the intensity of their character without flaw this film should have make them star shame on the studio for not put everything they have behind this film it could have easily be a franchise release on dvd be a must and a worthy remake would revive this film look for it in your tv guide and if you see it list no matter how late watch it you wont be disappoint do yourself another favor read the book same title itll blow you away time have change dramatically since those day or at least we like to think they have  n  a drifter look for a job be mistake for a hit man in a small wyoming town lead to all kind of complication cage be perfectly cast a the unlucky schmuck hop to make a quick buck and get out of town but find he cant escape the title town hopper do what he do best play a psycho know a lyle from dallas the real hit man walsh a a crooked sheriff and boyle a a femme fatale round out the fine cast the script by others john and rick dahl contains delicious twist and turn and johns direction create a terrific neo noir atmosphere witty and very entertain it suck the viewer in from the start and never let up  n  i really like this movie i have see several gene kelly flick and this be one of his best i would actually put it above his more famous american in paris sometimes it seem the story get lose in gene kelly movie to the wonderful dance and song number but not in this movie it be definitely worth rent  n  although promote a one of the most sincere turkish film with an amateur cast icecream i scream be more like a caricature of sincerity the plot open with the dream of ali a travel icecream salesman in a western anatolia town in which he see himself become successful use the same marketing method of big icecream company he dream of play in his product tv commercial with beautiful model in bikini dance around him a his dream turn into a nightmare he wake up with a big erection next to his gargantuan wife who reject to make sex with him for year with no apparent reason be it because he be not successful in his job apparently because he say he be sell well in the old day when there be no pressure from global icecream company but this be what he say we actually dont see him suffer that much he still sell good travel the neighboring village while his apprentice stay at the shop sell icecream to the people in the town ali blame big company for use sweetening and color agent while he be use real sahlep powder root of mountain orchid ali buy a motorbike with a bank loan to be a travel vendor and give ad to a local tv channel which prefers to oadcast even the news bulletin in local dialect his wife be not fond of his way of do business they always quarrel and ali threaten her that he may do very bad thing in a moment of frenzy in a very successful day his lousy bike be steal by the misbehaving little boy of the town in search of his steal bike ali go to the police blame the big company for the theft but of course nobody take him seriously annoy by the nagging of his wife ali go to a tavern and become drunk one of his friend at his table a wannabe socialist of the town give a didactic speech and criticize globalism and with no real connection jump to the subject of global freezing ali return home and decides to kill himself with poison his wife wake up and prevents him an old neighbor take him to a night walk and advise him about life accord to him ali can even sell hot sahlep drink if the world face with global freezing when he return home suddenly we see that his wife understand his value treat him like a hero and praise his manhood meanwhile the thief boys get sick eat too much icecream they confess to the doctor that they steal ali bike ali forgives them and there come the happy end although the plot may look promise in a way it the storytelling which make this film insincere and cheesy first the director doesnt show much of an effort to tell the story visually everything be base on dialog and the dialog never stop to show u that cinema be actually a visual art even alis trouble be not convincing because we dont see it we just understand it from his word the director market his film a a righteous fight of ali against big icecream company but there be nothing in the film about big company we dont see their pressure enough the film actually ridicule ali for believe that big company be behind the theft and when his motorbike be find it solve every problem ali become a happy and powerful husband not a real criticism of globalism second the film be cheesy because of the crude humor maybe the people of that part of turkey be curse so much and make so many vulgar joke in their daily life but vulgar language and crude humor be not enough to make a film funny i may have accept it if they be both vulgar and clever but they be not clever joke at all they be just cheesy maybe im wrong maybe american people may like oriental version of american pie style humor but american pie never have any claim to be a nominee for the oscar or to have a political message if you think that you can laugh by just see a man big erection in his short and we have to endure this joke twice or an old villager woman say f  k you then you may find this film funny  n  stan laurel and oliver hardy be the most famous comedy duo in history and deservedly so so i be happy to see any of their film ollie be recover from a oken leg in hospital and with nothing else to do stan decides to visit him and take him some boil egg and nut instead of candy chaos begin with stan curiously pull ollies leg cast string and manage to push the doctor billy gilbert out the window cling on to it get ollie string up to the ceiling when the situation calm down stan get ollies clothes a the doctor want them both to leave and he also manage to sit on a syringe accidentally leave by the nurse fill with a sleep drug which come into effect while he be drive which you can tell be do with a car in front of a large screen fill with some likable slapstick and not too bad although repetitive and a little predictable classic comedy it isnt great but it a black and white film worth look at stan laurel and oliver hardy be number on the comedian comedian okay  n  ok i have to admit that i quite enjoyed house of the dead despite it well document failing this however be the bad film i have see since demon at the door compare to datd the effect be vastly superior however the plot be weak the acting reminiscent of everyones favourite the porn film and the decision and action of the character consistently verge on the moronic i feel like try out uwe boll late cinematic outing just to get some sense of perspective over hotd i be not suggest that he be really the cure more a case of a different disease but when your sens have be insult in such an abhorrent manner the only way be up ok there it be i have manage the ten line minimum and shall waste no more of our time on the waste of celluloid that be house of the dead  n  i be unlike most of the reviewer not bear in the s  i be bear on may th despite this my life be very much in the style of the s  when other kid have playstations i be play zelda on my ne etc now this movie hold a special place in my heart already despite me be only year old at the time of write this review i because of my s style early childhood watch many tv show and saw many movie that other kid didnt see and this movie be one of those and one of the great too it start off in the los angeles home of alvin seville simon seville theodore seville and david seville david the chipmunk adoptive father be in a rush to get to the airport a he be go on a business trip around europe his taxi be almost there and the chipmunk help him pack while they be talk alvin express his will to come with dave and to see the world even though technically dave be only go to europe so to alvin apparently only america and europe qualify a the world david be leave the chipmunk in the care of miss miller much to the displeasure of the boy soon dave be off to the airport and the chipmunk be leave at home with miss miller later at a local caf   the chipmunk be play a game of around the world in day against the chipettes brittany jeanette and eleanore after lose the game to brittany after have his hot air balloon eat out of the sky by a crocodile alvin get in an argument with brittany about who would really win a race around the world two diamond smuggler sit at a nearby table klaus and claudia furschtien overhear their argument and need a safe way of transport their diamond over the world decide to fool the child into deliver them for them they set up a race around the world where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness secretely fill with diamond at drop offs around the world and receive a doll in the oppose team likeness secretely fill with the payment for the diamond to varify that they be there the winning team would then receive a dollar reward they do this because they believe that jamal an interpol agent who have be hot on their heel for some time now would never suspect them because they be just kid however this seem to be redundant because on their travel the kid do not have to go through any security check and be never even question about the doll i suspect that neither would klaus or claudia if they have take the diamond there personally and so begin a great adventure this film be a classic and i see no reason why anyone would not like it it feature great animation and topnotch voice act not to mention the kickass music pardon my french p my favorite song be without a shred of doubt the girl and boy of rock and roll an amazing rock song that can not be top it also my favorite moment in the film other notable song include get lucky kind of suggestive for a kid film eh and my mother as well a wooly bully and off to see the world not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credit perform by the royal london philharmonic orchestra the scene with my mother still ings a tear to my eye in relation to the song get lucky i first didnt think anything of it but when i grow old and learn about life it become clear that that song be a little bit suggestive that song along with the fact that the animator insist on the audience know the color of the chipettes panty this be especially apparent in the scene in egypt when the chipettes be be chase by the arabian prince men when eleanor lean over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely while this do nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film it one of those unexplained thing like why nobody in the world seem to mind that there be foot tall chipmunk walk around and speak in incredibly highpitched voice and treat them just like they would any human child anyway a bit after that scene the chipettes discover the diamond in the doll and decide to go find the chipmunk and get home the direction of janice karman perfect this movie a she and her husband ross bagdasarian jr  know the character good than anyone they even do the voice of the chipmunk and the chipettes ross do the voice for alvin and simon as well a dave and janice do the voice for all the chipettes and theodore speaking of male character that be voice by female voice actress nancy cartwright the voice of bart simpson make an appearance in this movie she play the part of the arabian prince a very small but important role the end be of course a happy one the crook have be catch the loose end tie and the film end when the child dave and miss miller be drive into the sunset alvin complain about not have get his dollar reward for win the race which annoy dave until he finally yell alvin and the screen fade to blackclassic end by the way i hope you find my review of this movie useful and if you havent see this flick give it a watch it worth the money this nostalgic classic from the s get a solid out of headin for the top dont you know we never stop believing now  n  just when i think i would finish a whole year without give a single movie a bomb rating a friend ought this notorious turd to my house last night i fear the bad know it reputation and it be as godawful a id anticipate this be a mexicanmade mess dub into english and produce by k  gordon murray it get terrible set and effect and feature a rather frightening santa who doesnt operate at the north pole but instead from a cloud in out space and who doesnt have little elf help him make his toy but rather all different group of child from practically every country there be the opening sequence where st  nick chuckle heartily a he observe monitor show all these kiddy work hard while sing terrible holiday song in a variety of language seem to go on forever and with no story obviously this santa claus doesnt observe the child labor law eventually we get some nasty and slinky redsuited apprentice of the devil himself travel from hell to earth just to make little kid naughty and turn santas christmas eve round into a nightmare watch this movie be a trippy and twisted experience and it bound to frighten little child and turn them off santa claus and the holiday forever oddly the name of jesus christ be mention often in this christmas film which somehow make it all the creepier in the context of all the bizarre thing that be go on this easily make my personal list of the bad movie ive ever see but im sure thats nothing unique  n  a be often the case when you attempt to take a plus page book and cram it into a two hour film a lot be lose here director john madden shakespeare in love take on an extremely ambitious project and almost pull it off what we get be a charming and emotionally compelling film that seem somehow incomplete there be much about this film that be wonderful and fantastic the cinematography by john toll cinematographer for braveheart and legend of the fall winning oscar for both be splendid work with madden the choice for location on the greek island of kefallonia be superb and the visual image that come from photograph these majestic location in vary light be lush and beautiful madden also use numerous greek actor a the townspeople give the town an authentic feel the soundtrack be also terrific and the mandolin passage and vocal by the italian soldier be marvelous madden do an excellent job of inging u the italian occupation and the romance which take up the great part of the film there be numerous sweet and funny moment throughout this segment however by the time the serious battle drama be ready to unfold there isnt much film leave in the reel and this component be extremely rushed and abeviated while the battle scene be well do subsequent to the battle it be obvious that increasingly great compromise be be make to keep the film from run too long by the time we reach the post war scenes the treatment be merely skeletal another negative be that the dvd be particularly sparse on features nicholas cage be charm in the romantic lead a the sentimental captain who seem to have join the army to sing rather than fight when fight he must cage switch gear seamlessly into a man of fierce principle and resolve and somehow remain believable in both personas penelope cruz whom the camera love give an uninspired performance a pelagia in part this be because cage so dominate the screen but cruz just seem too placid in a part that should be emotionally torrential and dynamic she allow the character to be objectify a corelli love interest rather than establish her a a powerful character in her own right john hurt give a fantastic performance a the wise old doctor who know as much about human nature a medicine however christian bale seem a bit overwrought and stiff a pelagias fianc   i rat this film an despite

rare film that depict a love story about people who happen to be africanamericans the dialogue be realistically write and deliver with honesty it be so nice to see a film where the story line center on young professional africanamericans this be virtually an untapped market love jones be visually captivate as well the chemistry between lorenz tate and nia long will ing memory of past and present love the feeling of the film be jazz and blue and ings to mine the sensuality of a warm creamy hot chocolate with a splash of kahlua and butterscotch if you hadnt guess i love it  n  the basic genre be a thriller intercut with an uncomfortable menageatrois fellowes have try to make a lot more out of this use the lie of the title in order to ing about all manner of small twist invariably design to surprise the character more than the audience its really rather messy though fellowes doesnt seem interested present the thriller element in a fashion that will keep u seatedged rather his focus be on the moral predicament themselves the dialogue be inconsistent stagey here vernacular there and with the constant surprise of realism undone by the occasional clich  landmine though there be no fussing over the location so that the actor can get on with exist in their space the dreadful score cant create a further dimension and often work against the emotional momentum of give set piece theres also a very prosaic dare i say it british feel to the filming i didnt want to see a document of two successful middle class people catch in an extraordinary situation i want to see some sort of artful recounting of the story finally it be in fact the story which let the rest down just a the element of suspense be rather flat so the story be an asymmetric sum of subplots of different shape and size woven a a vehicle for character examination wilkinson and watson support this metaessay with good performance and john warnabys ebullient colleague simon to wilkinson be a welcome foil for much of the owfurrowing im disappoint not that it bad but that it could have be much well  n  this be absolutely the best movie i have ever watch at the age of i be up late and ran across the movie it be on the usa channel gilbert godfreys up all night i will never forget at the time my friend and i be really struggle with different issue some sexual you know be a very rough and weird age it seem you be stick in between be a little girl and be a young lady this movie really help to answer a lot of question for me i now have a daughter that be have be search for a couple year for this movie if it ever do come out on dvd i would be the first to buy would recommend for any parent to watch this with their child when they reach that very rough and difficult age  n  hole be an awesome movie i love it a lot and it one of my favorite film it one of the few flick produce by disney that isnt cheesy hole be generally a very cool motion picture i wish disney would make more picture like it hole be indeed a rare eed of disney flicker show that be cool dont get the wrong idea i dont mean to bad mouth disney but most of it stuff be aim towards kid and thats okay child deserve to have their entertainment too but disney have be guilty of try to appeal to the teen audience and they usually fail but not with hole it the type of movie anyone of any age can watch and enjoy and not once think it corny really it the kind of movie that even a lot of young hood might enjoy since there be character in it that they can relate to holes do a good job of be a mix of good family entertainment but not be too cheesy and live a little on the edge i hope disney take more risk and make more edgy flick like this  n  i can not hate on the show when the old and good tech tv have to hit the icks the channel be reformatted and new show step in attack of the show be the replacement for the screen saver with cohosts in the beginning they be kevin rise kevin pereira and sarah lane brendan moran come to be something of a cohost as well but he mostly do prerecorded piece for the show kevin rise decide to leave the show and eventually there be a contest to see who would be the third host but that didnt pan out for some reason eventually i just learn this from this very imdb messageboard sarah lane and brendan moran move on because hey this be what i read the two get marry that be a big secret to me now there be a new female cohost the notashot my opinion olivia munn shes hide something in those top she wear while sarah lane have a perfect body and she wasnt afraid to show it ahem sorry attack of the show deal with everything young people want to know about it music movie comic book the internet and television this be whats great about the show if you dont want to bother with scour the net or waste time watch mtv you can get all you want on aots some segment and bit they do be funny they have regular guest and contributor who be in the industry as well a guest who range from insignificant internet star to actual big names even though the host arent as geek a id like them to be i still have find attack of the show to be entertain even with it late lineup  n  bad dcom i have see ever well maybe not as bad a smart house this be just bad the acting and story be fine but the effect suck they be so fake the only good fight scene be between the other and shen that be probably the only scene in which i be excited overall i find this movie very boring and the film kind of end suddenly i will give it a four for brenda song who be a very funny actress and that one fight scene    n  it awful i cant believe that one of the great nonsense in the world can be a blockbuster and the favorite movie of million of people a movie which have no storyagain shahrukh khan have be appear on the screen with nothing new the same a usual he be try to make you cry by start scramble his head for thousand of timesi think this be to muchpretty zinta spouse to act the character of a pakistani girl i didnt know that there be enough facility in pakistan for the pakistani girl to do so many plastic surgery on their face and also there be enough make up facility and also i didnt know that an indian can cross the march between both countriesgo to pakistan and start dancing and singing may be pakistani soldier be sleep  n  some people may call cooley high the same sort of thing a american graffiti but i wouldnt for starter in ag everyone be white whereas in ch theyre all black moreover this one have a motown soundtrack specifically the movie focus on several workingclass africanamerican student in chicago and their antic the movie deal mainly with home life and relationship in their apartment we see that there never any dad around but these young men always know how to live life to the fullest one thing that really distinguish this movie from most other portrayal of black people be that the teenager in this movie be portray a very responsible worry about miss school two really funny scene be the gorilla scene and the one white guy in the movie but overall the main star be the soundtrack it be truly one of the best soundtrack in movie history we even have it on vinyl here at home a classic in the real sense of the word  n  so wonderful so quirky so romantic so italian the film be so feather light you float off into it refract reality and you never want to return to the humdrum again a kitchen sink world of bakery and hairdresser and plumb but one that shimmer with a soft luminescence should the credit go to the screenplay or the direction take your pick theyre both faultless let me get back to that new york city that lie just beyond the look glass  n  this film be quite simply illiant the cinematography be good the act superb and the story absolutely eathtaking this be the story of donald wood a white south african who think himself a liberal until he find out the reality of apartheid kevin kline be completely convince so much so that when donald wood himself appear on tv some year later i recognise him from kline portrayal denzel washington also turn in a masterful performance a ever i urge you to watch this it be long but it be worth your patience because it tell such an incredible story remember folk this really happen  n  i have recently see this production on dvd it be the first time i have see it since it be originally oadcast in and it be just as good a i remember at first a be worry it would seem old fashion and i suppose it be a little dated and very wordy a the bbc serial be back then i miss those wonderful costume drama that seem to be always on sunday afternoon back then but that aside it be a near perfect a it could have be i be a bit of a jane eyre purist a it be my favourite book and have never see another production that be a faithful to the book a this one i have recently reread the book as well and some of the dialogue be just spot on read the scene near the end where rochester question jane about what st john be like i notice their word be exactly reproduce on screen by dalton and clarke and do perfectly all the other production that have be do all seem lack in some way some even leave out the river family and their connection to jane altogether i also think this be the only production to include the gypsy scene do correctly the casting be perfect zelah clarke be like jane be describe in the book small plain and dark and i disagree that she look too old timothy dalton may be a little too handsome but he be absolutely perfect a rochester portray every aspect of his character just right and act his sock off i agree with other comment that he even appear quite scary at time like in the scene when he turn around slowly at the church when the wedding be interrupt his expression be fantastically frighten but then in another favourite scene his joy be wonderful to see when jane run down the stair and into his arm the morning after they declare their love for one another a love that be wonderfully portray and totally believable oh to be love by a man like that there be a couple of scene that be strangely miss however like when jane climb in to bed with the die helen and also when rochester take jane shopping for her wedding thing i think that one be in it but maybe my memory be play trick  finally if you never see another production of jane eyre you simply most see this one it be simply perfection  n  in a time of bad if not plain awful comedy king of queen be more than just a eath of fresh air it a complete oxygen tank it be in my opinion one of the best comedy show of all time nothing have be this good since marry with child kevin james and jerry stiller be comic genius and believe me it take a lot to make me label someone a comic genius these guy truly understand what be funny i could watch ten episode of seinfeld and wouldnt get half the laugh from see koq just once other funny people in this show be carrie janet heffernan spence and doug pruzan carry bos im so happy they manage to get so many season from this gem the show have be a hilarious winner in a time of mostly comic loser check it out if you havent  n  prey aspect ratio sound format monoa lesbian couple sally faulkner and glory annan living in a remote country house be drive apart by the arrival of a young man barry stokes who turn out to be a flesheating alien the vanguard of a massive invasion     despite it shoestring budget and leaden pacing norman j  warrens followup to satan slave amount to a great deal more than the sum of it meager part thanks to a surprisingly complex script by max cuff apparently his only write credit faulkner and annan indulge an obsessive relationship whilst living in isolated splendor within the english countryside render alternately beautiful and ominous by derek v  browne eyecatching cinematography though annans discovery of bloodstained clothing in an upstairs room mark one or both of these doeeyed lovely a psychologically disturb which may explain the absence of their respective family some of whom appear to have live in the house at one time or another and leave under mysterious circumstance stokes unexpected arrival throw the relationship into disarray partly because faulkner have a pathological hatred of men and partly because annan be attract to him create tension which result in a climactic whirlwind of violence there an extraordinary multilayered sequence in which faulkner attempt to emasculate their clueless visitor by dress him in woman clothe though stokes alien mentality allow him to rise above the intend mockery in the early scene at least the relationship between faulkner and annan be depict with uncommon grace and dignity but this heartfelt sapphic liaison quickly devolve into crowdpleasing episode of sex and pulchritude culminating in an explosion of horror when annan allow herself to be ravish by stokes follow a violent argument with faulkner the closing sequence be quite literally gutwrenching especially annans final scene which appear to have be clip for censorship reason in and never fully restore what remain be still pretty vivid so ace yourselves excellent performance by the three lead bolster by warren unobtrusive direction which take full advantage of the stunning woodland location thereby compensate for the film budgetary shortcoming originally

to much quieter time ahead michael gaffikin james warwick a former paratrooper in the british army be the local dentist he not an islander by birth and a such his relationship with local artist and cartographer fiona patterson celia imrie be always be view with a little suspicion not maliciously but just out of the protective instincts the tight knit community have for their kin the island serenity be oken when gaffikin out for a solitary round of golf find the headless remain of a utally slain woman he immediately report his gruesome find to insp inskip maurice ro    ves at the island police station inskip arranges for delivery of the remains to local gp dr goudry for close inspection a quick search for the killer prove fruitless as do a search for a missing local woman over dinner that night with michael gaffikin fiona realises that the dead woman might be sheila anderson a woman from the mainland who live on the island through the winter month a quick search at her home dove cottage reveal the miss remains of her body her home proving to be the murder scene but why do the killer drag her torso over a mile into the wood suspicion immediately fall on the one stranger leave on the island one colonel howard jonathan newth who also happen be the last person to see her alive a they come across on the last ferry together goudry asks gaffikin for some dental expertise on the victim body it reveal that she have be tear apart my somebody or something with great strength one set of teeth mark on the body seem to point at a human killer another point to that of an unknown animal of some kind a sheep be find mutilated and then a canadian ornithologist be find slain with a heavy fog roll in the island be cut off from the mainland and any possibility of help the radio also doesnt work seemingly be block and the phone line have be cut report of ufo and the sighting of a camouflage soldier be compound by the finding of an odd look craft hidden behind rock on the beach inskip be confuse and refuse to listen to anything but the fact and laugh off gaffikins idea that alien might be involve but a rise in radioactive level on the island have him doubt himself the nightmare man be base on the novel child of the vodyanoi by david wiltshire it be here adapt by dr who and blake scriptwriter robert holmes and direct by douglas camfield who also have direct experience on both sci fi classic and the film benefit from have such experienced genre expert on board the nightmare man though be on the whole a succinctly well craft piece that build it plot alongside solid character development even down to the minor character time be give to give them all a firm background the island setting be perhaps a genre clich   that have be use over and over but it one that i enjoy very much the remoteness the sense of be under siege with no way out always add to the atmosphere and here it be give an extra oomph by have an impenetrable fog close in to hamper all effort in many genre effort of this kind it be very easy for proceeding to get silly and for the plot to resort to melodrama but credit to camfield he hold it all together with the emphasis be on believability at all time there be an authenticity about proceeding the character even speak gaelic at time to far this point if there be one negative about the killer it that we be give his her its pov for the killing an acceptable clich   on it own but when see through a red filter and a fish eye lens it just scream of overkill and date the film just a little still though you will be hard press to guess the outcome or the identity or for that matter the specie of the killer give the clue present but it a fun and very well act piece the local scottish cast be exceptional the local bobby roeves and cosmo in particular spar well off each other and be a delight to behold imrie never one ive take to in other work be also pretty good and display hew womanly physique a if she be in a hammer production the outlandish maybe even preposterous end may irk some viewer it disappoint me in some way but take into account when it be make it an understandable and acceptable addendum that if you think about it be even more terrifying  n  this review also contain a spoiler of the first movie so if you havent see either movie and want to but dont want the spoiler please dont read this review while this movie be suppose to be about christian and kathryn meeting for the first time the movie be a poor copy of the first cruel intention the actor that they have portray ryan phillippes christian and sarah michelle gellars kathryn be very poor substitute indeed neither can pull off the smarmy snooty richkid attitude that the original actor do it absolutely appal that some of the dialog be verbatim not so much between christian and kathryn but if you listen closely enough youll recognize it there be also inconsistency in the plot if this be truly the first meeting of christian and kathryn then why be it that christian fell in love with a girl at the end of the movie he supposedly be suppose to be in love for the first time in the original movie with reese witherspoon character  also the tiein with the photography you could be a model comment at the end be totally lame and didnt add anything at all overall this movie be a waste of time i cant believe they make a cruel intention  n  this movie be ridiculous it attempt to be a comedy but the screenplay be horrible the whole movie be do in low light and you cant grasp the fact that it a comedy truly be bad cinematography you really have to sit there and watch it to realize there a few joke here and there go on but either way theyre all inside joke amongst themselves this be more like a wannabe drama flick that go bad it really be a very pointless movie their expression reveal nothing but dismay and disaster which turn out that way anyway unless you want to be bore out of your as i suggest you stay away from this gag of a movie  n  in dramatise wilde novel john osborne have condense event eliminate a number of character and generally imply rather than show dorian essential wickedness if you want a more explicit render see the film wilde and robert louis stevenson live in about the same time frame but be certainly vastly different men and writer this story really treat of a theme similar to stevenson dr  jekyll and mr  hyde but note that wilde choose to treat his story a fantasy whereas rls take the scientific route both the protagonist be men in whom good war with evil with evil winning in the end the actor in this bbc movie take a different route too from those in the film john gielgud say all the same caustic and cynical quip a george sander in his role really project wilde himself but with a subtle difference youll suspect that sander really believe what he be say but gielgud may be say what be expect of him rather than what he sincerely believe peter firth too show the two side of his character in restrained fashion but then we dont get to see a many of his escapade a hurd hatfield have a chance to display its a very good production with the dramatisation reflect the essential of the novel if not all of it ramification  n  it start out like a very serious social commentary which quickly make one think of other clark movie like kid bully etc but then just a quickly it unravel into a directionless mess who be the main character be this a serious film or some gregg arakiesquire over the top goofy film be this a skate documentary with moment of dialog insert i have no clue i find myself watch the clock and wonder when this turd be go to end i keep think there would be some big shocker culmination which never come i cut a good minute out of the movie by fast forwarding through the pointless skate scene yes it illustrate the change landscape between the have have nots i get it way back in the beginning kid and bully be do in such a way that i actually felt like i be observe the reality of that group of friend wassup felt very stag poorly construct and ever bad act teenage caveman which larry didnt write but do direct be terrible but at least it felt like it be suppose to be a terrible movie that didnt take itself seriously wassup rocker be just plain bad  n  this be my first deepa mehta film i saw the film on tv in it hindi version with it sita character present a nita i also note that it be radha who undergo the allegorical trial by fire in the film and not nita sita yet what i love about the film be it screenplay by m mehta not her direction the character big and small be welldeveloped and seem quixotic towards the endsomewhat like the end of mazurskys an unmarried woman they be ave woman surround by cardboard men and one cardboard man ashok seem to come alive in the last shot we see of himcarrying his invalid mother biji he seem to finally take on a future responsibility beyond celibacy and adherance to religion m mehta seem to fumble a a director however compare to most indian mainstream cinema she would seem to be illiant a she can not use her script to go beyond the microscopic joint family she be present except present a glimpse of the chinese microminority in the social milieu of india she even dedicate the film to her mother and daughter not her father yet her radha reminesces of halcyon day with both her parent in a mustard field compare her to mrinal sen adoor gopalakrishnan muzaffar ali and she be dwarf by these giantsgiven her competent canadian production team and financial resource mehtas film of two bisexual lady in an indian middleclass household may be sacrilege to some but merely capture the atrophy of middleclass home that do not seem to aspire for something good than it immediate survival in a limited social space kannada malayalam and bengali film have touch parallel theme in india but do not have the publicity that surround this film and therefore have not be see by a wide segment of knowledgeable cinemagoers ms da ms azmi mr jafri and mr kharbanda be credible but not outstanding m azmi be a talented actress who give superb performance under good director mrinal sen khandar gautam ghoses paar benegals ankur a illiance notably absent in this film m da sparkle due to her screen presence rather than her acting capability all in all the film strength remain in the structure of the screenplay which be above average in term of international cinema i be sure ms mehta can hone her write talent in her future screenplay  n  all the way though i be think to myself oh god why at the very begin i think right it might be average but the acting and plot on most part be atrocious every part in it be so predictable even though the first movie seem to bare a large resemblance to the ring it be a half decent movie but this just seem to take all the good thing about the first and make them terrible some bit make everyone in the audience wet themselves eg the part be geller fall off the building have me in stitch my girlfriend have to keep tell me to quiet down i be keep comment on what be bind to happen next and more time than less i be right why do go into the house make her come after you it doesnt make sense it be a poor excuse for a lot of killing and no really depth be see at all you can see everything come which just leave you feel that there be no point in watch oh shes behind her     didnt see that one come  yawns  surely these people must have think to     oh i dont know carry a knife round or at least try and fight back instead of be eat but someone hair at best during the movie i be very mildly scared and i mean mildly i be just cry out for the credit a they roll i exhale a short oh thank god if you havent already dont waste your time and money on this pointless plot less sorry excuse for a sequel  n  at a high school student commits suicide not show who have take their life or reason know time skip back to the start of the day from here we follow six separate student marcus melody luke steven sarah and sean each student be struggle with their own moral dilemma all reach boil point hit to an end for one after lose a friend to suicide and survive his own suicide attempt writer director murali k  thalluri have create a revet drama focus on teen life and the horrible act of suicide suicide have be a topic that have be keep in the shadow be thalluris attempt to ing it to light if you have be touch by the act of suicide or anyone who have become all the harder to view with heavy and hard subject matter thalluri also tackle everyday teenage life crisiss sex pregnancy sexual identity bully friendship thalluri manages and show them in an extremely realistic manner the factor on thalluris talent be his subtlety he respect his subject and the problem that everyone will have suffer through at sometime it verge near documentary at time it have such a painful realism the interview with each character splice through the film only heighten this have a distinctive similarity to gus van sants film elephant while the core of each film be different both tackle teen life like sant thalluri utilizes long track shot with time skip back and forth to show each character interaction from different perspective a define point to elephant be it ethereal ambiance with spare conversation little development of character and the long track shot sant create a haunting and mesmerizing atmosphere to a come dread while there reside this dread in the emotional connection to the character reach a high level sant couldnt reach a time go by each character fragility creep out drag you along their emotional rollercoaster the real hit in this film come with the inevitable suicide foretold at the very begin the hard part about this scene be the complete intrusion and discomfort we have a an audience watching someone life end in a gruesome fashion though many film that have show suicide gloss over the act or romanticize the act thalluri show the pain and agony involve with this act and that it not the best solution with unknown in the lead and their first major role teresa palmereach frank sweet joel mackenzie marni spillane charles baird and sam harris all show immense talent and promise act careers compelling and revetting be an absolutely unmissable film  n  the quote above just about say it all for slipstream i should have bail out of this film after the first half hour but decide i ought to be fair and give it a chance i wont watch it again so if anyone with the temerity to do so can get back to me with the number of clich  d line in the movie im sure it will set a record some otherwise fine and talented actor get mixed up with this clunker mark hamill portray a futuristic bounty hunter and bill paxton be his quarry paxton character have hijack hamills prisoner an android take his name from the poet byron bob peck tasker hamill shoot owens paxton with a dart contain a tracking device so he and his companion belitski kitty aldridge can keep tab on the pair the real question though be why didnt he just fire the device at byron thereby cut out the middleman if you enjoy scene after disjoint scene with tedious characterization and artsy fartsy pretense then i suppose youll find something of interest here but you cant convince me that the film make sense on any level scene of a futuristic stone age make way for high society snobbery but the pinnacle of poor taste be reach when paxton character be display follow a night of revelry with hickey all over his torso if anyone think theres some hidden meaning here youre really stretching patiently wait for the frame proclaim the end to come into view ala even that be deny if beauty be in the eye of the beholder then so be understand this movie have neither yet there be a single redeeming feature a the closing credit begin their run an awesome view of a half dozen hot air balloon apparently the film be keep them afloat  n  director edward sedgwick an old hand at visual comedy successfully lead this hal roach road show which tender a fastmoving and adroit scenario and excellent casting employ a large number of roachs reliable performer although the film be originally plot a a vehicle for patsy kelly sunny jack haley star a joe jenkins a young kansan who sell his auto repair business and journey to hollywood where he attempt to wangle a screen role for the girl he love starstruck cecilia rosina lawrence sedgwick who prefer use the entire mgm studio a his set do so here a cecilia always ready for an audition be treat by a wouldbe paramour cinema star rinaldo lopez mischa auer to behindthescenes action of naturally a musical comedy feature broadway headliner lyda roberti laurel and hardy provide several enjoyable interlude include their wellknown skit involve a tiny harmonica and we watch fine turn by such a joyce compton russell hick and walter long on balance one must hand the bay to mischa auer who clearly steal the picture a an emotional movie star a role which he largely create and to the director for his clever closing homage to busby berkeley filmic spectacle  n  the joke be obvious the gag be corny and the character be walk characatures but i couldnt stop from laugh at his highly entertaining movie no matter how many time i see it i still get a kick out of this one and i recommend it highly for all lover of mindless entertainment it contain many quotable moment and some of the best sightgags ive see to this day if youve have a bad week and you need a chuckle rent this one on your way home friday night to give your weekend a good start  n  these slasher pic be past their sell by date but this one be good fun the valentine card themselves be witty and well think out the film have one peach of a line     hes no angel     when he in fact be angel watch buffy rerun will never be the same the cast be a sizzle display of young talent but the story do not give them enough real depth denise richards on the dvd extra seem to think the girl on set bond well together and this would give the feeling that you empathise with their character sorry but no the direction be very good managing to show very little actual gore and rely on your imagination imply threat much can be say also for the similar manner in which miss richards and heigel do not remove their clothes     essentially the main directorial plus lie within the borrowing of various other idea from previous slasher flick psychos shower scene be tributed along with halloween mask murder someone hiding in a bodybag though be a pretty original one as far a i know light view not very scary but a few good jump moment if it be a choice between the hole and this though choose the hole slasher movie have have their day and this be just another slasher a very good slasher but nothing groundeaking  n  the only reason i give this episode of master of horror a instead of a be because the two lead actor be good and it wasnt shot on vhs the story the dialog and the plot be ridiculous talk drive zombie who come back to vote and sway the political tide against the war give me a eak what next zombie who come back to go skydive maybe zombie who come back to host qvc show i never support the iraq war but i do support the courage and sacrifice of the men and woman of our armed force and homecoming be disrespectful in that it mock the true horror of war with zombie be mass produce in todays market     this be the spam of zombierelated entertainment how homecoming make it onto master of horror be beyond me  n  like most i think another crocodile movie so far weve have primeval and rogue in the last month what can they do thats new where both those film be about action and violence this one about fear and tension the performance arent oscarworthy when there nothing go on but in time of distress or terror these people suffer so much it like torture there be hole in the plot and maybe crocs dont really behave like this a others have point out but the fear be so effective it a stretch to say youll enjoy this movie itll leave you feel as uncomfortable a the passion of the christ  n  there be a couple of prior comment here which opine about this flick abundance of clich  s throughout and i agree completely both with regard to the character and the dialog id read about elizabeth berklys awful performance in the equallyawful showgirl which ive never see and her performance here while not awful be barely up to the standard of lifetime bad fare there be not a hint of depth to her character but then there probably shouldnt have be if so it would have place the film completely outofbalance since there wasnt a hint of depth or charisma not a trace in any one character performer or portrayal the principal handle of lizs initial complaint after her tutee have kiss her in the hall be laughable her husband initial reaction and advice be likewise forrest gump attack jennys boyfriend in his car provide a more realistic intelligent action and hell he be mentallychallenged  the smarmy unctuous lawyer excuse the redundancy father of the lie student actually perform something probably worthy of praise in his performance he be both laughable and thoroughly annoying at the same time no mean feat her attorney be more of an insensitive nerd also not unknown in the profession finally and frankly i rather enjoy this part the police be such a collection of insensitive oaf that youd rather depend upon barney fife without andy to handle all law enforcement and investigation in your community i know that most reallike cop fall a bit short of the sharpness intelligence and empathy of the level display by most character on the law and order series and the like but dolt of this level seem to be a staple on lifetime finally i find a kind of story within a story fascination with joshs concoction of his be the victim of his teacher this script performance within the story be even bad than his overall performance in the main story this be something of an achievement like go from f to fminus this whole lame situation should have be resolve in real life in about minute follow a realistic meeting between teacher and school authority with husband involve but then that would have preclude the contrived drama follow and leave an hour blank film in the camera but the writer s here prove with their end they could do even worse when the situation be finally resolve and right this be accomplish in all of about second with no indication of what measure might have be forthcoming in any real world context for the perpetrator and his parent or whether they might have be able to find some sort of path toward redemption this one a presentation the second because it do have some mild fascination  n  if you havent see this yet you really should on dvd i cant believe how much i enjoy it it be amazingly realistic and believable true much of it be speculate and i would have like to have know more about what be speculative and what be proven fact there arent many of them but it handle everything quite well with a cruel mother nature theme it will remind you of the nature program that youve see on animal planet and the discovery channel only the animal here be dinosaur they act natural they eat kill mate play and fight for survival you will actually find yourself root for some of them and against others for the most part the effect be excellent at time they will look a little too much like cgis but then you will see them in a different angle that make them look more realistic in some case you will actually be convince that youve see a dinosaur my favorite be the coelophysis the raptor the diplodocus the iguanadons the allosaurus and the arctic biped i be most disappointed with the trex however which look a little too computer generate at times in any case you should definitely see this production it be educational well make and very entertaining for what it be it an a  n  why be it that canada can turn out decent to good movie in every genre other then action i catch dragon hunt on tv the other day and it be like a train wreck i just could not change the channel it sheer stupidity sap my willpower it pretty telling that the cast imdb credit with this monstrosity apparently never work again bad act bad write bad narration bad music bad hair bad cinematography it just go on and on the movie really have nothing to recommend it if youre look for bad action film to enjoy by laugh out there be a tonne of other film that wont require you to scorch out your retina afterwards i hope this film didnt get money from the government for financing otherwise im never pay tax again  n  ab tak chhappan be a fictitious story surround a police department in mumbai india sadhu agashe be a hard work hardedged cop head up a plain clothe crime squad who make a name for himself by kill dangerous criminal in staged police encounter rather than lock them up in prison his loyal officer obey him without question but a rift form when one of his officer imtiaz becomes frustrate by sadhus high ranking status and be secretly compete with him for criminal kill and status a new recruit be also push into the fraternity and imtiaz be angry when sadhu allow him to take the lead on his first case far change come in the form of a new police commissioner who disapprove of sadhu tactic and everyone get catch up in internal politics i be surprise to see such a well direct action thriller come from india the camera work be excellent the story be well told and the tension be high when the drama unfold the act pace and political subterfuge convince the viewer that they be a fly on the wall witness the blood sweat and tear from a close up and personal view and that the event be base on reality which be no doubt why we be tell that it be not at the beginning of the film although it be likely that the director shimit amin have take liberty with factual account nevertheless ab tak chhappan be an extremely polished piece of filmmaking  n  let keep it simple my two kid be glue to this movie it have it flaw from an adult perspective but buy some jellyworms and just enjoy it and the pepsi girl be excellent and kimberly williams be pretty goshdarned hot although shes not in the film very much so dont get too excited there not thats it really a bad thing but it be the kind of movie you watch just once dont buy the dvd enjoy do i mention kimberly williams that be for the dad  n  it be a m  in the morning and i have nothing else to do dont judge me     please were back in time during the spanish settlement a group have make their way onto an island it doesnt take too long before they encounter a large reptile which gobble up their horse soon theyre capture by the native and in order to gain freedom they must kill the reptile gods the cg suck it remind me of the cg of early console video game the encounter be lame the only positive thing i have to say about this be the hottie native run around in a skimpy outfit otherwise it just a middling effort  n  lackawanna blue be and excellent movie the casting be perfect every actor and actress be perfectly suit for the role they play their chemistry together be amaze the acting be superb i felt a if i know the character i could almost feel them they remind me of people that i know a a child grow up in the s and s  oh the memory my personal belief be that this movie should have be on the big screen for all to see i have watch this movie so many time that i can almost recite the line a the character be say them i cant even list my favorite part because i have so many favorite part thank you for inging back a part of my youth that i never see in this day and age     and that be black people love each other look out for each other respect each other care about each other and do all we can to help each other get ta go now i have to go watch it again  n  saturday june pm the neptunemonday june pm the neptunefew celeations of ethnic and cultural identity succeed as mightily a carlos sauras illiant interpretation of isaac albeniz masterpiece iberia suite at the approach of it centennial saura draw together an unprecedented wealth of talent from the spanish performing art community to create this quintessential love song to their homeland the twelve impression of the suite be present without narrative in stark surroundings allow the power of each performance to explode before sauras camera creative use of large flat and mirror move throughout the set combine with screen shadow fire rain and rear projection add glorious dramatic effect to the varied selection of song dance and instrumental performance photograph of albeniz reappear throughout the program connect the passion of the music to it great creator saura encompass all spaniard on his stage from the beautiful elegance of elderly flamenco dancer in traditional costume to child joyously dance with their instructor  n  a most people i be tire of the by the number clich  d movie that hollywood make there seem to be no creativity in hollywood company only want to spend money on remake be sequel that have an audience build in this movie be a welcome change it could be classify a romantic comedy for it genre but dont let that turn you off this movie this be a very original movie which be not like most thing hollywood produces if you be read this you already know the basic plot so i will not bother go over that the only movie that come to mind to compare this to be interstate and art of travel which be little known gem that take a different path than most of the hollywood garbage this be well worth see if you be tire of watch more of the same dean  n  many of the review and comment i have read about this movie say that this be a rather stale film and performance by clara bow although the storyline be rather typical of claras late silents i still find it somewhat heartstirring and incredibly fun clara play a happygolucky hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she love     never mind that this man be married claras lack of modesty be shock in the day but i believe it lend to the sweetness and general fun of the movie though definitely not a illiant storyline quite typical actually this movie be a nice showcase of claras ability to make the audience laugh  n  a the number of video nasties ive yet to see dwindles this little pile of garbage pop up on my to rent list when i saw it be available the premise involve a fashion model or something be kidnap and take into the jungle to be hold for ransom by a motley crew of idiot some other goof get hire to ing her back and be give a sack of money to use a a bargaining chip though if he return with the girl and all the money he get a significant cut he ought a helicopter and pilot with him and wow that pilot be one of the bad actor ever grant they be all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood after steal away into the jungle we learn that nearby be a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wander the wood like a human king kong look for tribeswomen to ravage and devour now this fellow be just a naked guy with some of the bad makeup ever pingpong ball for eye and thats pretty much it his growl and groan be an everpresent feature on the soundtrack and i find myself mute much of those scenes oh do i forget to mention the almost constant nudity this be probably the main reason this film be ban though there be one specific scene about one second long where the god attack a girl and pull her gut out but it not a redeeming factor for gore fan also jess franco go beyond the usual t and a and show lengthy closeup of female genitals and sadly male a well so if you want fair in term of exploitation you get it i cant recommend this trash to anyone it not even the good bad movie it just atrociously padded trash that only a video nasty fan will probably view and even then if you be make your way through the list leave this for the very last if you watch it first you may get the notion that this be the norm for the list which be certainly not true  n  i rent this thinking it would be pretty good just by the cover of the movie case judge and jury start out pretty good killer chase the man who kill his wife on a bike with a cool gun but this movie get progressively stupider a it go on david keith be awesome actor especially when he play a role like this too bad the movie be a piece of crap it really waste his talent judge and jury be well plain dumb i give it a should have give it a i give it an extra star just because david keiths gun be cool  n  i find out about this film because jewish ben chaplin from game on be in it game on be a funny british sitcom and apparently he leave because he want to eak into hollywood and star in this film he fail thank god the film be a very simple romantic comedy with janeane garofalo play an ugly woman who use her neighbour uma thurman to date ben chaplin because she think ben chaplin wont like her because shes ugly the film be just bad for so many reason the plot be unbelievably predictable from the overtly slapstick bit to the serious mushy bit ugh just that montage where all three of them be have fun and then the photograph bit those two scene make me cringe janeanes character be sickeningly arrogant and guess from her role a standup comedienne and archfeminist be in real life too she claim that the film be antifeminist when in fact it just realistic men more often than not go for looks over personality it interesting to note her hypocrisy too shed be a feminist and comedienne for year before take this role and then suddenly decide afterwards that the film be bad i imagine she hat the idea and script of this film before it be release but she make sure she keep that quiet so she could get pay for this travesty of a film i mean come on she act in it for heaven sake what this film be really be antimen if anything it portray men a stupid animal whose ains be in their groin with the men do stupid thing to attract the attention of uma thurmans character noelle there be other bad thing about this film too like ben chaplin character be the british man every american girl find cute and jamie foxx be the token black best friend of chaplin and of course foxx have to try and mimic his accent a few time for good measure be that the best the script writer could come up with blimey theyve never do that before except with every hugh grant and dudley moore film ever make there also a truly awful phone sex scene which be just grotesque and prove how cheap the film be the other comment on here all say how janeane garofalo isnt ugly but be actually beautiful erm be i watch the same film a they be shes certainly no looker and the only good thing about this film be that she be rightly cast a the ugly one although have say that i fail to see the appeal of uma thurman as well shes lanky and gaunt looking i guarantee three thing about this film if youve never watch it you will know what the end will be you will find the phone sex scene painfully embarrass and you will be bore after ten minutes watch at your own peril  n  this movie have everything typical horror movie lack although some thing be far fetch we be deal with quality snow man engineer the only preview i can reveal be that i cant wait for jackzilla dare i say oscar winner this be a perfect date movie i advise all men for a nice romantic surprise see this movie with that special person  n  have just see walt disneys the skeleton dance on the saturday morning blog a link from youtube i use those same source to watch a remake do in technicolor for the columbia cartoon unit and animate by the same manub iwerks the color compare to the early black and white be really use imaginatively here and many of the new gagslike when one of the skeletal band player hit a wrong note constantly or when one lose his head and take another one off or when one dance with the other with part of that other goneare just as funny a the previous short it do get a little repetitious near the end still skeleton frolic be well worth see for any animation buff who want to compare this with the early silly symphony  n  the cast of this film contain some of new zealander well actor many of who i have see in fabulous role this film however fill me with a deep shame just to be from the same country a them the fake american accent be the first clue that thing be about to go spectacularly wrong a another review rather astutely note the luxury cruise ship be in fact an old car ferry decorate with a few of the multi colour flag steal from a used car lot most of the cast appear to be from the great long run new zealand soap shortland street it a if this movie be dream up at a shortland street cast christmas party the result of too many gin and possibly a bit of salmonella imagine under siege meet the love boat stag by your local primary school and direct by an autistic and you get the idea if you be an actor i recommend you see this film a a study on how to destroy your carer  n  emily watson and tom wilkinson together what a treat with rupert everett and linda bassett round off the support role to the foursome of lie and intrigue yet at the heart of it all each character maintain a streak of decency moral conscience hold up in spite of obvious contradiction contradiction be the source of all movement and of all life how true these word be watson anne manning be at the core of this intrigue shes the central conscience that the other three latch on she be the decency undeterred the circumstance of lie be to each it own one to defend one professional name one to hold back due to family partner pressure one simply dont want to face the consequence one ironically cant believe the truth and lie to save friendship these be all precarious situation there lie the intrigue fascinate to watch how each tackle truth and lie contradiction indeed in spite of the seem dishonor decency and heart remain strong the treatment of the subject involve and how each of the character behaves be masterfully deliver simple with clarity it not sensational or complex a another film where the truth lie credit due to fellowes writing and the nuanced performance of both watson and wilkinson there be warmth somehow that come through the seemingly boldface or frustratingly hidden lie beneath it all human frailty not exclude they mean well and follow along with the story the turn of event provide satisfaction and smile to how the two mannings seem to have grow and mature in their relationship you might say there no obvious action drama or thrill scene in separate lie yet the intrigue be there and it will hold your attention the deserve production effort include cinematography by tony pierceroberts a veteran to the merchantivory film and music by stanislas syrewicz with mood and tone reminiscent of composer zbignew priesner of filmmaker krzysztof kieslowski trois couleurs especially bleu this be a british

with some of the review of this film the only place that seem to tell the truth be rottentomatoes com this film be awful the plot be extremely lazy it be not scary either people out there who think that because it star sarah michelle geller it be somehow like the grudge should forget about it this film be more like dark water except it be even more predictable and slow moving than it i be extremely disappointed with this film it didnt scare me nor interest me either let face it this type of plot have be flog to death at this stage e g the dead try to contact the living dragonfly what lie beneath ghost story dark water darkness the changeling etc etc it seem to me that the only one write original horror film nowadays be the japanese and the korean the film that be come out of hollywood like this be cynical exercise in money making without a shred of respect for the viewer theyre just be churn out  n  angela sandra bullock be a computer expert but be shy and somewhat of a recluse she do all of her work from the confines of her condo just a she be about to take a vacation in mexico a coworker send her a computer disc with disturb information on it angela agree to meet with her fellow employee but he mysteriously die in a plane crash angela head to mexico but take the disc with her while she be sun on the beach a terrific look gentleman name jack jeremy northam make overture to her she fall for them and the two end up on a boat to cozumel however jack work for the folk who generate the secret information on the disc and he be out to get it even after angela escape from his clutch and land back in the usa jack make thing difficult he change angelas identity on every computer across the nation make her lose her condo her bank account everything can angela a computer whiz beat jack at his own game this very exciting movie have many asset first bullock and northam be two very beautiful interesting actor and their presence add immediate captivation the script be very clever and sure in it knowledge of the capability of computer and their relevance in todays world the costume set production and direction of the movie be also quite wonderful and despite how it sound there be a great deal of excite action a angela go on the run to defeat her enemy if you love thriller without unnecessary bloodshed or violence this be a great choice it deliver twist and turn with great frequency make it possible for the viewer to net a very good evening of entertainment  n  i rent the dvd in a video store a an alternative to read the report but it pretty much just more terrortainment while the film may present some info from the report in the drama youre take the word of the producer theres no reference to the commission report anywhere in the film not one the act all around be pretty bad pretty much all of the stereotype of hot shot bitchy foul mouth government agent each think they know more than everyone else there may be some truth to it but it really have a bad hollywood stereotype smell to it imdbs user community rating comment tend to be more right than wrong and i have start to glance at the rating before rent whenever i can i wish i have on this one  n  look this be a low budget horror film that suffers from all of the problem that go with low budget movie but you must see this just to watch lisa erickson a julie she be smokin hot and a great little actress to boot these type of horror movie often unearth a rare gem and the power give u lisa erickson nothing i enjoy more than sit down in my studio apartment with a coke and put in this film my friend bob bill and dennis agree   lisa be not only illiant she be a hottie the movie itself often plod along and the rest of the actor be not very helpful in that regard but as soon a lisa hit the screen thing really start hop the others be clearly not in her league this be not the exorcist but a i say if you want to see a fun little movie with a hot little actress this be the one to see  n  it wasnt until i look at the trivia section that i find out that the original producer star of this movie tyrone power die during it make this no doubt explain why everyone on screen seem to have their mind on other thing a symptom of which appear in a very early scene involve a battle that can only be describe a pathetic you know when youve be paint a wall until youre completely bore well thats the sort of expression the combatant have on their face when theyre swing their sword in a highly unconvincing manner the plot centre on soloman the king of israel have an affair with the queen of sheeba and his people not be happy about it you cant really blame them since there few thing more beautiful in the world than those israeli moteks though the israeli woman here all seem to look like cherie blair modern day israel be also very cosmopolitan with the majority of israeli be bear outside the country but would this have be true a couple of thousand year ago where everyone speak in european and american accent after much talk and a dance sequence that have to be see to be believe and no thats not praise we have a climax where the heavily outnumber israeli have to defend themselves against a massed egyptian army who cant read a map otherwise they would have know there be a canyon in front of them this be what i dont get even though their blind by the sun the egyptian spend ten minute charge towards the israeli never ever realise theyre charge towards a gaping ravine isnt this somewhat illogical it also something of a revealing error since the horse chariot and men fall into the canyon be obviously miniature figure anyway the film end with soloman kill his treacherous other and praising god for his victory but who need moshe dayan arik sharon or god when youve get an idiotic enemy who cant see a ravine in front of him or wave a sword like he paint a wall  n  i be a huge woody allen fan and so when i saw that this be play at the cinema i couldnt help myself i want to see how allen would follow up his magnificent film match point see a this be another one of his film shoot in g b which be unique among allens work along with what seem to be his new muse scarlett johanson scoop be much light than mp and the humor be scoop most enjoyable aspect the plot revolve around johansons character a journalism student who get a tip on a hot story from beyond the grave she fall in love with a suspected serial killer jackman and she must decide whether the truth be worth find oh and all of this be do with the help of a bumbling magician turn detective play by allen i must say that i thoroughly enjoyed johansons performance but i be a bit bias i could watch a three hour film with johanson in ever frame and remain enchanted she play a ditsy yappy bumble sweetheart that be kind of a variation in a sense of allen stereotypical neurosis stricken character she add appropriate body language for comic effect needle to say almost anyone who see this will find johansons character sickeningly cute and that be a plus allen be allen     he be still play the same character much like chaplin and his little tramp character something that occur in this film make me wonder if i will see the neurotic little hypochondriac again however he be not in the cast of his next picture and have be spend more time exclusively behind the camera a of late     jackman be also enjoyable a the suave millionaire murder suspect i can not say that jackman do anything in particular to make the role his but he suit his character none the less in term of the plot i can not help but feel that this be fresh     in fact it stink of curse of the jade scorpion johanson and allen be more detectivelike than anything however i must applaud allen on his end because it be a bit more clever than your typical unoutstanding hollywood version of this film instead of everything be black and white thing be paint in shade of gray be entirely innocent have nothing to do with it nor do unequivocal guilt though the plot seem old woody still have a knack for one liner i do find his allusion to his last film interest     come for the humor laugh and be merry needless to say if you enjoy allens work watch it if not watch something else      n  i rent this film because of my interest in american history and especially the somewhat weird story of the mormon this movie attempt to make some sense out of how joseph smith could turn his vision into a major world religion it first focus on the trouble the mormon have in their settlement at navuoo illinois it portray the trial of joseph smith within the course of that trial brigham young stand up to tell of his conversion to mormonism and of his belief in the spiritual message of smith then smith be assassinate and young must deal with his own doubt about whether he have be choose to lead the mormon to a new land despite his grave doubt he persevere and finally have a vision that utah be the place for his colony that give him confidence in the rightness of his leadership later a crop be destroy by cricket he again doubt that he have truly be chosenhowever a miracle occur which cement his place in history i find the performance to be move and the story to be convincing and interesting i would love to know whether mormon believe that this be an accurate portrayal polygamy be a part of the story but the reason why this be central to lds be not raise the issue be not emphasized im sure people stay away from this movie because of it religious subjectmatter but it have a great cast and will hold your interest throughout  n  s frightmare be an odd little film the director seem to be try to combine the atmosphere of classic s s style horror movie with the shock factor of the thenexploding s slasher genre it isnt totally successful mostly due to very obvious budgetary restraint and the lessthanprofessional caliber of it cast of young actor but it still have it moment mostly due to the classy performance classy than the movie deserve by the late german actor ferdinand mayne who play an age old time horror movie star ala vincent price name conrad ratzoff at the beginning of the movie we meet the hasbeen horror star a he shoot a commercial for denture and we quickly learn that ol conrad be a bit of a hoitytoity prima donna jerkoff just when you think he couldnt be any more unlikable the commercial director berates conrad for blow a take for the umpteenth time and the old goat push him off a balcony to his death nice huh conrad then visit some fan at a college campus horror movie club unfortunately he suffer a heart attack in the middle of his speech to them and eventually end up back at his mansion wait to die still feisty even at death door he manage to do away with a despised business associate by smother him with a pillow before he finally kick the bucket himself conrad be then lay to rest in true hollywood style in a high tech neon tomb with video screen above the casket which will play personal video message from conrad himself for visitor who enter to pay their respects it be at this point that the kid from the college horror movie society decide to pay conrad grave an after hour visit eaking into the tomb and take his body back home with them for an all night party not exactly my idea of fun but hey these be character in an s horror film logic have no place here the college kid spend the evening have dinner with conrad body seat in a place of honor posing for photo with it and even dance around the room with it before park conrad and his coffin in the attic planning to return him to his crypt in the morning in the meantime mrs  ratzoff distraught over the theft of her husband body have call in a psychic friend to try and reach conrad through a seance you can pretty much figure out the rest from here since conrad wasnt a very nice guy in life it not much of a stretch to assume that he wont be any friendly in death psychic lady make contact with conrad and he reawaken in predictably tick off fashion then spend the rest of the movie stroll around the corridor of the student ridiculously huge house pick off the young grave robber one by one this be where the movie fall apart endless scene of teen wander around empty hallway say hello be anyone there be intercut with occasional burst of violence we do get a pretty gnarly decapitation scene which be the highlight of the movie before the last two survivor finally figure out way later than any semiintelligent people would have figure out the same thing     but again be in an s horror film that the only way to stop the mayhem be to get conrad body back to it crypt where it belong the sluggish pacing be pad out with a lot of weird lighting and dry ice fog effect back by a soundtrack make up almost entirely of sound effect rather than music thunder moan and groan howl etc that become severely annoy after a while i cant really recommend frightmare to anyone who didnt grow up watch cheap movie like this on late night cable back in the s  modern horror fan will doubtlessly find frightmare incredibly slow moving and goofy if you come of age in that magical decade however you may get a blast of nostalgia from frightmare fan of jeffrey reanimator comb may also want to check it out a the future dr  west appear in an early role here a one of the unlucky film students i will advise the reader to avoid the version of this film on the eastwestdvd label pair with roy ward vault of horror and sell at dollar store because the print quality be terrible im tell the film have get a deluxe release via the fine folk at troma which seem appropriate if youre a troma kind of person then frightmare will be right up your alley  n  people watch movie for a variety of different reason this movie didnt have the big budget theres no special effect no car chase and theres no explosion actually reality doesnt have much of these either at least not in my life this be a very real movie about very real people none of them perfect in any way but together they be put into a situation where they learn to explore and accept what be different and that in turn make order out of chaos i be not prepared to limit the possibility of parapsychology since im neither an expert nor use the full extent of my own ain so watch this movie for the character it be imfull of a whole cast of wonderful quirky folk within the first three minute kiefer sutherland enacts detective michael haydens life superbly and he keep develop the character throughout the movie excellent act very believable henry czerny could not have be cast well and the rapport between his harvey and kiefers mickey enhance the oppositeness of their characters i thoroughly enjoy the cranky landlady mr ramsay im sure she and my motherinlaw be good friend theres a host more of these wonderful character but space be limit here so watch the movie and enjoy them  n  i think that you can not imagine how these people really work     before i come to the studio to watch the guys work there i actually think quite the same a you do but since i saw and do the work the guy on that tvshow have to do i have to say that they really do deserve respect for what they be do all day long that really be no easy work and also the actor which in your eye may be terribly bad be really great people and a lot of them really can act i dont think that the material give to them can really show that a i think this material isnt very good but they be truly good so i dont think that you before you havent see these guy do there work can judge over them and i shouldnt have judge over them as well before i meet them but i do and be now terribly ashamed of it so please do not allow yourself to judge over these great people unless you havent see them do there job  n  a usual i be make a mad dash to see the movie i havent watch yet in anticipation of the oscar i be really look forward to see this movie a it seem to be right up my alley i can not for the life of me understand why this movie have get the buzz it have there be no story a group of guy meander around iraq one day they be here diffuse a bomb tomorrow they be tool around the countryside by themselves no less and start take sniper fire no wait here they be back in bagdad there be no cohesive story at all the three main character be so overly characterize that they be mere caricature by that i mean we have the sweet kid who be afraid of die we have the harden military man who be practical and just want to get back safe and then we have the daredevil cowboy who doesnt follow the rule but have a soft spot for the precocious little iraqi boy try to sell soldier dvds what do you think be go to happen well do you think the cowboy soldier who doesnt follow rule be go to get the sweet kid injure with his renegade way why yes do you think the iraqi kid that cowboy soldier have a soft spot for be go to get kill and make him go crazy why yes there be no story here the script be juvenile and predictable the camera be shake around a lot to make it look artsy and for all of you who think this be such a great war picture go rent full metal jacket deerhunter or platoon dont waste time or money on this boring movie  n  a group of friend eak down in the middle of nowhere one have a flat tire the others jeep mysteriously wont start one of them take the tire to a run down service station and that be the last anyone see of him when the remain foursome go in search of their friend they come across nice mr  slaussen who offer to help fix the jeep and offer cool drink and refuge from the heat in his equally run down hermitlike house which happen to be occupy by very realistic look mannequin he go with the one guy in the bunch out to work on the car and leave the girl in the house before he go he warn them not to leave and go up to the house behind his shack he warn them about davy his other who be lurk about and isnt all there of course one of them decide to venture out in search of a work phone and be never see again be it slaussen be it davy the mannequin tourist trap have the usual horror requirement jiggly big boobed girl goody two shoe girl curiosity get the good of people and never work out but it stand apart from the rest of the s genre in it twist of an end i start to feel sorry for slaussen chuck conners be a terrific creepy overthetop performance at a point in the film and you almost see the character of molly do the same this be a gem if you can find it i have tap it off of cable when i be young and walk through a used video store i spot a vhs copy that be totally overpriced but well worth it fan of tanya robert wont be disappoint either best part of the film for me be the scene with the soup and cracker i give it a because some of the movie be and still be hard to explain  n  most lorne michael film seem to fail because theyre essentially just extend version of skit that barely manage to make people laugh in fiveminute segment tommy boy be a character right from snl a big fat lovable in their opinion goof who doesnt know anything david spade get the thankless overwhelm everyman role he pair with the annoy overweight slob and they endure miserable misfortune a they travel cross country to save daddy business the plot for starter be really faulty the whole premise daddy dy and rich stupid son have to save the family biz can be trace back to just about any movie you want like any snl style film it be reduce to a simple motivation empty shallow just a reason to see a fat guy and a thin guy be funny together the movie big influence be the comedy classic plane train automobile that movie be great because the plot isnt stale and recycle it basic yeah a guy travel home for thanksgiving get stick with a slob but it real dammit it make all the difference the character be real the situation be far more real tommy boy be pure slapstick and it ridiculous situation undermine the character we feel nothing for them and we dont care about whats happen onscreen pta walk the careful line between outrageous and utterly believable and relateable tommy boy be simply absurd with joke like a simple deerintheheadlights turn into a crash turn into a struggle with a dead deer that really isnt dead then awakens and wreck their car the whole wreck car thing be steal completely from pta and it eerie how much stuff in this film actually do resemble the steve martin john candy movie farley be simply way too obnoxious to find likable ive never enjoy watch him in any movie and this hasnt change my mind spade give very little to do serve a the movie most thankless character dan aykroyd be waste a the evil baddie who plan to destroy daddy business the end be a joke and not in a harhar funny way more like a oh god be they serious way some people dig it thats cool but i just cant get into it nor do i appreciate all the stuff it borrow from not just count pt a without any credit whatsoever  n  have read during many year about how great this film be how it establish ruiz among the french critic specially the snobbish cahiers crowd when i finally watch it about a year ago i find it pretty disappoint but then i guess my expectation be skyhigh shot in saturated black and white this deliberately cereal film make for tv and mercifully only an hour long be tell in the form of a conversation between an art connoisseur and an offscreen narrator a they ponder through a series of painting which be show in the style of tableaux vivants and try to find if they hold some clue about a hidden political crime the awful kate beckinsale film uncover have a similar argument borgesian be a word i read a lot in review about this movie but i would say almost any borges story be more interesting than this film  n  many teenage sex comedy movie come and go without much fanfare however every so often a movie might come along thats honest funny entertaining and memorable the last american virgin be a special movie that have find it place and have stand the test of time blend all four ingredient this film follow three friend gary rick and david the big apple misadventure into the world of firsttime sex and true love along the way they learn hard lesson and the value of true friendship we follow hopeless romantic gary the main character on his quest to win over the girl of his dream which lead him down an uncertain road with a surprise twist at it end if you havent be lucky enough to see this movie yet by all mean take a look     sprinkle with many memorable s song throughout the movie to keep thing move at an even pace l a v truly be an original film a rarity among film of it genre  n  i love this show from it first airing and i always look forward to watch each episode every week the plot character write special affect be outstanding then the scifi channel screw up yet again and cancel a very entertaining well write show i say ing it back i know all of the actor would come back i would suggest buy the dvd i be i hope the scifi channel executive get word of these comment and realize that they need to be more involved with their viewer i only watch one show on that channel now ghost hunter but i be fairly sure that shortly they will cancel that too  n  i didnt know what to except so i think it be a lot well not have except much dont get my wrong it not a bad short film te nanavati be a relatively new directer and writer so i think she deserve a lot of kudos for make this film you can tell that it have be an act of love for her the acting outside of dominic be a little cheesy and the quality of film be not great either but for a really low budget film it good there be time when the story line get convolute and there be part that drag on though i dont feel it greatly detract for one ability to understand the film if you love dominic monaghan as much a i do i say go for it the gag reel be fun i wont spoil it but there be a particular scene that make buy the dvd worth it just so you can watch it over and over if you like the film then check out the pink mirror a film also do by jagged edge i know fan of dominic will enjoy this little piece of heaven  n  do the first travesty actually make money this be another sequel along the line of another stakeout that no one ask for but weve receive it anyway the sequel be like it predecessor completely aindead it also pretty disgust remember the dinner scene to think i almost felt sorry for ritter yasbeck and warden do they need the money that much  n  i be never so bored in my life hour of pretentious selfobsessed heroinaddicted basket case lounge around whine about their problem it like watching lizard molt even the sex scene will induce a serious case of narcolepsy if you have insomnia rent this  n  this movie be awesome on so many level     and none of them be the level that it be intend to be awesome on just remember this when youre watch shaun of the dead and other recent zombie movie     be they good or bad     this be the formula that they be use this be what make zombie movie so great and what make it good than great be the story behind the movie a simple web search will provide you with everything you need to know all in all it doesnt linger there never a point where you think to yourself cmon get on with it     it move quick and corner nicely this be the sporty little italian number of zombie flicks so awful it wonderful if your tongue spend an ample amount of time in your cheek     rent it buy it love it as a great trivia note if youre watch it on dvd youll notice that there be sound effect during the menu screen underneath the musical score     well     thats because that music be lift straight from the trailer     which be probably the only work print of that music that still exist which be long enough to loop  n  the lady man be laugh out loud funny with a great diverse cast as well a have some very stupid but excellent scene include the funny love song ever write  ferrell be his usual quality self in a illiant side role tim meadows play an idiot surprisingly well and have write himself some of the funny line youll find in any comedy out there it be definitely worth a purchase a watch it every month or so will lead to you still laugh as hard a you do first time round i be distraught to think at the time of write this that it have a meagre and i urge you to vote and remember kid theres more motion in the ocean  n  when i first hear about this movie i think it would be like the duchess but when i saw the first minute of the young victoria i know this wouldnt just be a solid movie almost everything in this movie be great the costume be really amazing and the setting be also beautifully shot the only thing that really let me down be the performance emily blunt the devil wear prada be the star of the film inging victoria to life and with this movie she show that she be a great actress and maybe pick a first oscar nomination for her performance rupert friend be almost bland a prince albert but he have great chemistry with emily blunt paul bettany be also solid a lord melbourne although i expect more of him jim broadbent and miranda richardson both have support role but be forgettable to me the film feel like unfinished maybe that the screenwriter change too many thing in the script i dont know but thats how i feel about the movie but overall it a great movie about the early year of victoria with a great performance from emily blunt  n  a fly saucer man literally by a crew of about male space explorer travel hundred of million of light year from earth to check in on a colony found some year ago on a forbidden planet what they find be a robot more advanced than anything imaginable on earth a beautiful and totally socially inept young woman and her father a hermit philologist haunt by more than the demon of the ancient civilization he have immerse himself in on the surface this story be a pulp scifi murder mystery some compare it to shakespeares tempest but this be a stretch and in some way an insult to the scifi genre strip of what make it a scifi film sure it the tempest but how many hundred of film can you say something similar about underneath this be a cautionary tale about progress and technology and the social evolution necessary for it appropriate and safe use yet the film still proceed with all the hopefulness for our future that we have come to expect from show like star trek anne francis be not the only reason why this film be best describe a beautiful the special effect and even the aesthetic of the backdrop be powerful enough to make the uninspired directing and uneven act almost unnoticeable if it be not for the goofy retroartdeconess of s scifi prop you might think you be watch a s piece this be a classic of that very special subgenre of sci fi i like to call s scifi and though not in my opinion the best it be certainly a must see for anybody interested in scifi film and special effect the clever plot now render trite by it reuse in six or seven episode of star trek lose in space and even farscape be worth pay attention to and will sustain the interest of most scifi fan trekker will be particularly interested in the various aspect of the film which seem to have inspire theme of star trek original series air about year later though they may find themselves disappoint by the relatively mild s sexism and the lack of any kind of racial integration while i do not mean to nitpick the lack of social progress manifest in this film be the one major problem i have with it some will probably see this film simply to catch a glimpse of young goodlooking leslie nielsen in one of his first star role unfortunately nielsens performance be only average and at time downright poor especially at the climax of the film walter pigeon though quite excellent in other film overact his role as well m francis earl holliman and the amazing robby the robot be the standout actor in this crowd though on the whole the character actor fill in the ensemble do a good job the problem with the featured performance i think be as much the fault of the director and the editor a anything though they certainly get most of the film quite right  n  i just saw this film on dvd last night and decide to check out the review this morning it seem that i robot have polarize the critical viewing community here on imdb and give rise to a lot of insult and namecalling too  i find this somewhat surprising a this film be not great or even good but neither be it terrible or even really bad what this film really be be     depress depress that the u filmgoer population be so ready to lap up insipid clich  d reheats and acclaim them a spectacular new work this film a retread write all over it from the plot line an uneasy mix of asimov and modernday uberaction to smiths character a smartmouthed cynic with a backbone of titanium to the special effect that borrow from matrix and a few others  i robot be sadly quite possibly the perfect action movie for today audience superficial plot insipidly snappy dialog and lot and lot of adrenaline smith be mediocre but we already know that he seem to be hollywood late unsuccessful attempt to create a black bruce willis the story have lot of hole in it of all size but i dont think most people draw to this film be criticallyminded enough to notice perhaps a blockbuster by todays standard but very bmovie compare to true winner  n  this be a fine example of how an interesting film can be make without use big star and big effect just tell a true story about the struggle of two african american woman over a turbulent century this movie challenge u all to look at our own personal prejudice and see that people be people not white black etc good movie with a good message  n  i have buy the complete season of surface watch it in day i be so capture by the the plot theory and basically everything about this show the actor who play mile be great mile sister mother and father act like real life family would you could connect on so many level it fascinating i find animal be so wonderful you can almost connect with them a a parent be to a child it would be something if a creature of this sort of nature truly exists am sadden that surface be not have a second season or at least four more show i have so many question that need to be answer and hopefully maybe they will create more or maybe in a book love the show very much for those who havent watch surface if you like scifi you need to watch this  n  this must have be one of the bad movie i have ever seen i have to disagree with another commenter who say the special effect be okay i find them pretty bad it just wasnt realistic and they be so fake that it just distract from the actual story maybe that distraction be the reason that i do not fully understand the story the archaeologist be look for the set they do not bother to tell what set or what be so special about it that also make it unclear why they search for it in california while the intro of the movie take place in ancient egypt if youre shoot a movie that take place in the desert take the effort to actually go to the desert the begin the ancient ceremony look like it be shoot inside a studio instead of a desert the actionlevel be constant throughout the movie no ups and down no climax it make the movie look short and thats certainly a pro for this particular movie  n  liam neeson portray the scottish legend robert roy macgregor from the early th century he be a true actor he captivate the audience with his charisma a he do in all his role jessica lange be excellent a his wife mary mary be such a beautiful woman it her love that make rob roy the legend but it his passion that make her love undying they need each other tim roth a the evil cunningham be perfect in one way or another upon watch the movie you will find cunningham disgust the scotland scenery be beautiful the environment and condition of the time be depict quite well if you like history romance passion and love youll enjoy rob roy there be violence and blood but it unavoidable in tell this story a it should be tell no gratuitous violence and you do have to listen carefully if youre not use to a scottish accent one important point that make this movie so good be that no one actor or actress be glamorize they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scene it their skill a actor that attract you they dont rely on marquee name popularity or sex symbol appeal this be something special  n  when i watch this movie i too get excited when see bed scene of miss world she have beautiful and charm body when cute lady do bed scene and show her fully nude body     i think male have hard to resist      i think it time for cute girl like hrishita bhatt also do nude scene at least no one want to c nude body of ugly woman like seema biswas to c in bandit queen i concur with what mallicka b have say the movie be portray in a way which appear to be a kind of vilification on the original content emotion arent convey properly i guess a couple of notsogood performance also contribute to it mediocrity in my view tabu would have be a much good choice for such a role instead of aishwarya rai in some of her scene she look a bit lusty which be not ultimately what the movie should have portray i also notice a bit of overact in some of her scene im a bitter critic of aishwarya rai cant help it sorry for that raincoat be a good movie by rituparno ghosh and i saw choker bali after see raincoat i be not at all impressed  n  theyve show i twice in a very short time now here in sweden and i be so very tired of it the bad act isnt enough     the story itself be so boring and the effect hardly exist i love the original from so i recommend you to go and rent that one instead because this one be such a bore  n  have see carlo lizzanis documentary on luchino visconti i be bind to high expectation before watch this film make three year later by adam low but the viewer like me do get dissatisfied     i face a need for critical opinion which i generally dont like give due to the fact there be no documentary that will satisfy every viewer there be also no documentary that will examine a theme totally but when i read the review already write on this title i also felt a bit confused people sometimes dont know what to criticize therefore to be clear ill divide this film into two major part that differ considerably the former one about visconti before his director career and latter one about visconti the director the aristocratic background all the hobby the wealth that young luchino experience and enjoy be clearly present his effort in horse racing be mention as well a his relation with his mother so much disturbed after his parent divorce we also get a very accurate idea of where luchino be ought up a a real count of milano in rich galore with nanny cook with access to everything in true aristocracy for instance his father splendid villa at grazzano and other marvelous villa prove that there be also an emphasis on visconti crucial visit in paris in the s where he meet eminent people leave winger who later have impact on his style and message in art that clearly explain the idea of a communist with the aristocratic up a contrast at first sight however the part about his director career which start with ossessione during wwii and end with innocente just before the director death in be poorly execute his movie be not discuss well why because there be very few people who really have something to say franco zeffirelli the director remember the work on la terra trema and that be all right there be also some interview with franco rosi but later such movie like il gattopardo la caduta dei rei la morte a venezia or ludwig be mostly discuss by helmut berger although i like the actor in the role of ludwig i do not like the interview of his moreover some thought he reveals be not accurate to entail in such a documentary     there be no mention of significant work of visconti like conversation piece there be no interview with eminent cast burt lancaster a mention about silvana mangano and romy schneider should also be make there be one footage interview with maria calla that appear to be interesting but that be only a short bit franco zeffirelli though i appreciate him a a director make fun of it all rather than say something really precious for instance he mention the event how visconti separate from him after year of service therefore i say simplify and unsatisfactory what i find a strong point here be footage interview with visconti himself a a result we may get his own opinion about his work for instance i very much appreciate the word he say about death regard it a a normal chapter of life and as natural a birth itself he also discuss his health problem after the stroke while film ludwig i believe it be well to see luchino visconti by carlo lizzani than this doc although it be short and condense a a whole you will get a good idea of the director visconti would be furious about that and the fury of his usually turn people emotion and viewpoint into stone      n  time be precious this film isnt i must learn to ignore critic who rave about small film like fargo and this complete waste of time the theater be pack and everyone leave with the same reaction be this the film the critic be rave about what a piece of crap the hook of this film be the upwardly mobile black daughter seek out and find her white trash family get it the acting be superb the production light set edit sound be about step above a minute story the character be shallow and unintelligent i be insult by the fact that these people could not figure out about each other what be blatantly obvious to the audience the audience be murmur to the movie screen what the character should say next i have have more fun do the laundry  n  bad movie ever make ever i have no word to say about it   other then it truly have no point no plot no     anything sheer crap i dont know how everyone in the movie didnt shoot them shelf after watch it                    i love vampire flick and mystery and alternate abstract outside the box film and     this be non of those i mean what the crap i cant even tell you what the film be about cuz i still dont know and i just waste an hour and ahalf of my life watch it     bottom line   i think the maker of this film just want everyone to do drug thats the only thing i get from this film please dont watch this     i mean for a sultry sensual vampire flick there wasnt even the to be expect nudity youd get from a vamp flick anyway back to my point     this movie blow go set yourself on fire instead            n  savage island be a lame movie it more like a home video shot with very minimal lighting and horrid act not only that the storyline and script be wretched i dont know why this movie be make i have see a lot of flick in my time and the one i really hate be movie that make me angry this one make my blood boil the situation be inane at best if i make a movie like this it would have be a short really because those backwood idjits wouldnt have be in the picture dont be fool by the cover on the d v d i be an avid watcher of bad cinema but this movie be virtually unwatchable i dont mind movie be shoot on d v but if youre go to do that make the movie enjoyable not some tired retread of superior horror film sans wrong turn  i have to not recommend this waste of disk if you come across this one in the rental store pas on by movies that make yours truly angry get an automatic  n  i have to say this be my favorite movie of all time i have see it well over time actually have to buy a new copy a a result of overwatching it be what the eighty be like and what a romantic story with a few moral throw in i highly recommend to anyone want to relive the high school day again buy a copy now it be a classic  n  i saw it at the legacy theater in the joseph smith memorial building in salt lake city this morning im go to assume that one level of enjoyment during this movie will largely be base on one level of acceptance of joseph story however that aside it be very well make well acted and have a nice score if you get to salt lake city it be a must to see it in the legacy theater i have never be in a nice theater as far a picture quality sound quality and ambiance in my entire life     i wonder if the church would let me watch batman begin there be that im lds and regard joseph a a prophet i be touch in several place and be ought to tear quite a few time     which i presume be expect since they hand out tissue before the movie start anyway im tell that this film be available in several lds visitor center around the globe if you have minute check it out because whether you believe joseph smith or not he tell a fascinating story  n  adenoid hynkel a lowly soldier in world war one rise in subsequent year to become the ruthless dictator of toumania he create an aggressive antisemitic war machine and cultivate a little toothush moustache sound like anyone you know from the safety of hollywood chaplin use this soapbox to exhort europe to take up arm and defy hitler and mussolini give that the united state in have more than a year of neutrality ahead of it and no strong desire to emoil itself in europe civil strife remember it be hitler who declare war on the usa not the other way round it be surprising that chaplin be allow to distribute this immoderate polemic the story involves on the one hand the the vulgar and repellant hynkel and the reign of terror over which he ineptly preside and life in the jewish ghetto where every single person be friendly humane ave etc etc chaplin be hynkel and he also play the jewish barber the little hero of the ghetto the tramp in all but name needless to say chaplin write directs star compose the music and do the catering in the full truth be not yet know about the third reich and chaplin can be forgive for have something less than perfect historical foresight but even by the standard of the day he get hitler badly wrong a comedian and a sentimentalist chaplin try to ridicule hitler by make hynkel silly and hapless all this do be to humanise him when hynkel the notverywarlike soldier fool around with the big gun and the upsidedown aeroplane he become endear rather than despicable a dictator he inspect his subordinate technical innovation which dont work the parachute hat the bulletproof uniform etc and these passage be mean to make u think that the reallife nazi be incompetent and can be sweep aside in fact hynkels regime be make cute and likeable by it bumbling bodgery in truth chaplin day have already pass when he make this illconsidered polemic at heart he be still a dinosaur of the silent screen check out the humour with gag like stagger up and down the street semiconscious or the pantomime of the coin in the pudding the hero schultz be mean to represent a yardstick of european decency against which hynkel can be judge but schultz look more like a character from operetta than a nazi be it in any way believable that a schultz figure if such have exist would say to the fuehrers face your cause be doom to failure because it build upon the stupid ruthless persecution of innocent people and how do schultz come to be in the cellar of the jewish ghetto if he be the object of an exhaustive manhunt why do he persist in wear his ruritanian uniform chaplin do not yet know the full horror of auschwitzbirkenau or treblinka but the nazi concentration camp which he offer u be hopelessly out of kilter with the grim spirit of the age a usual chaplin think in term of silent comedy setpieces loosely peg onto the narrative clothes line there be the knockabout scrap with the stormtroopers shave a man to the accompaniment of brahms and the globe ballet watch for the segment film in reverse  paulette goddard be the unremittingly perfect hannah just a the people of the ghetto be impossibly nice and the jewish haven in osterlich be ridiculously idyllic so hannah be quite literally too good to be true brave defiant resourceful hardworking and of course beautiful she be the canary of judaism in the ghetto cage gee aint i cute she ask after the barber give her a makeover too cute by far be the answer she doesnt come close to ring true because chaplin have make her a caricature the wouldnt it be wonderful speech which chaplin put into her mouth be typical of the author too wordy too emotionally cloying jack oakie be great a napaloni the fascist dictator of bacteria he ings a whiff of muchneeded comic io to the proceeding but the film underlie weakness remain if napaloni be silly and ineffective how can we fear him and anyway the stutter stopstart of the backprojected train be a fine chaplinesque example of a gag that be persist with far beyond it comic worth and where do the jewish barber acquire that immaculate hynkel uniform  n  milo be yet another answer to a question nobody ever asked do we really need more slasher i for one think we already have more than enough i guess the professional tall guy overcharge so in this one we deal with a murderous kid thats also a zombie or a ghost when he feel like it a long time agohe drown but that didnt bother him and he still kill people friday the thwhats that  one dayhis survivor have a big reunion and a a surprise twistmilo come to pay them a visit through some really bad shot that show everything except the murder the cast be thin out till only the final girl be leave to find out milos dulli mean dark secret she and her friend have be die to know once discoveredmilo go on yet another murderous rampage isnt it his bedtime yet and the girlwell she scream a lot the acting be not even bottom of the barrelthe barrel refuse to be associate with it milo can be one creepy bastard from time to time i give him thatbut some movie just cant be save without a great script or gratuitous nudity  n  this be one of the best horror suspense film that hollywood have make in year or maybe even decades even though in my opinion this movie be predictable in part it have everything that a good film in this genre should have chill thrill and yes a lot of gore house of wax sure delivers in part it be sort of farfetchedthe acting be not that greatbut my overhaul rating for house of wax be an eight out of ten         if you enjoy be at the edge of your seat this be just the right movie for youi have to admitit be sort of neat see the whole town make out of wax         i myself enjoy these museum but after see this film i will now look at them in a whole new different way  n  never saw the original movie in the series     i only hope it be a much good movie than this or the sequel make in the s a if it be not how be these two terrible sequel even justify this movie have a really good lead in when they be advertise it to be show on one of those old independent station that be a thing of the past now anyways it look like it would be a pretty good scary movie it be however a movie that would make some walt disney movie look dark really this movie be just a bunch of light fluff with virtually no boggy creek creature to be see the only real sighting be near the end when you see it shape during a very heavy rainstorm other than that there be virtually no sign of the creature which be really disappointing a a kid the story be basically the old evil hunter must kill anything they see and be after the boggy creek creature and kid be out to help it or just some random hairy guy in the wood that like to pull random boat through the water not really worth watch i would however like to see the original grant the maker of that would make the also bad boggy creature of the s but he also make a very good slasher movie in the s the town the dreaded sundown  n  create in and originally name mortimer before walt disney change his name because his wife convince him mickey mouse have become the staple of the disney and i always think this cartoon be the first ever cartoon to feature mickey it be in fact his third but it doesnt matter for a six minute animate short it be enjoyable the story see mickey pilot a steamboat until captain pete take him off the idge stop to pick up cargo and minnie mouse miss the boat be lift on she drop her music sheet and a goat eat them mickey help her crank it tail and play the tune and get some other animal to be percussion until pete come along again to stop him make mickey peel potato mickey mouse be number on the great pop culture icon and he be number on the great cartoon very good  n  highly regard at release but since rather neglect immense importance in the history of perform art a classic use of embedded plot one of my favourite film why hasnt the soundtrack be rereleased  n  the perfect murder be foil when a wife play by mary ellen trainor once the wife to director robert zemeckis who helm this episode who murder her husband with a poker have the misfortune of receive a visitor a she be about to move the body outside  an escape insane madman dress in a santa claus suit play by a deviously hideous larry drake she fend for her life while try to find a way of hide her husband corpse she decide to use an ax once she down the santa killer who miss several chance to chop off the woman head to frame the killer for her husband murder santa killer lock her in a closet and pursue the woman daughter a she try desperate to free herself to save the child this episode of tale from the crypt just recycles tire material involve the old santa kill theme while also add the oftused add nauseum womanmurdersherhusbandforamanshesbeencheatingwith routine it essentially trainor try to find a way to avoid be catch with a dead body she kill while also keep a safe distance from a maniac there nothing refreshing or new about this plot which pretty much go through the motion not one of the show highlight  n  the imdb plot summary in no way describe the essence of this film it should have read be prepare to be catapult back to the prison of the rd pew from the back of your familys church at year old listening to the preacher drone on about god will while all you can think of be get back home to your lego it start off well intentioned build intrigue by plant some real and surreal clue such a rennys how do the cut on my thumb heal so fast moment it then slowly morph into a christian jamboree sacrifice it plot completely in a wash of evangelisticinduced babble i believe i count the use of the word pray about time in a five minute span near the end after the st i try to twist the context of the word to it synonym prey sadly this little mind game of mine make the film at least bearable for the last minute plus it make me laugh whenever a character would say prayer preyer to me a it become totally zany indeed even my catholic wife sunk in her chair from boredom almost to the point of end up on the floor for all the salivate christian who rank this film star i suggest stick with your theologyreinforcing safety standard like circle square the ten commandment anything from narnia jesus christ superstar and the like stay away from more cereally challenge subject matter in film such a jesus camp the god who wasnt there what would jesus buy or the soontobe release religulous maybe robert whitlow book be well  n  te of the storm country be possibly the best movie of all of mary pickford film at two hour it be quite long for a silent film yet continue to hold your interest some year after it be film mary give one of her fine performance at time the role seem like a great hit performance with bit of mary the innocent mary the little devil mary the little mother mary the spitfire mary the romantic heroine etc characteristic that often be use throughout a single film in the past the movie be surprisingly frank about one support character illegitimate child for and at one point our little mary be think the unwed mother in question if the academy award have be around in no doubt the best actress oscar for the year would have be marys  n  i first saw this movie when i be about year old my mom buy it at our local kmart because it be on sale for on vhs she think that it would be a nice christmas movie for me and my others to watch this movie however scar the hell out of me you may be ask yourself how could a movie about santa clause scare anyone the plot of the movie revolve around satan send one his minion pitch to earth in an attempt to kill santa and ruin christmas thats right satan send a demon up from hell to kill santa clause pitch stalk santa throughout christmas eve in an attempt to trap him on earth when the sun rise on christmas day for if santa doesnt make it back to his home in space he turn to powder dont get me wrong the movie be funny and fairly entertaining however the image of demon and devil dance in the depth of hell which occur at the beginning of the movie be just downright creepy  n  although there be some snippet in this part documentary hint at the necessity for recreational drug law reform these be not very welldeveloped in contrast to the many snippet from those who feel that the drug that happen to currently be illegal be a scourge for which the only imaginable solution be incarceration of even those who be guilty even of mere possession of such drugs although this program a a whole leave the viewer with the impression that the drug war be largely a futile exercise and a waste of money and for that it deserve some praise almost nothing in this documentary address the very real problem that total war against those who merely possess illegal drug obviously cause and contributes tovery real problem that most drug warrior themselves would tell you if ask they think the drug war be design to solve for example while many minute be spend on the surge in violence associate with the rise popularity of crack cocaine in the s at no point do this program even hint that the very law design to suppress crack cocaine make it impossible for drug seller to enforce their contract and business arrangement in court of law force them to resort to violence to stay in business but instead of see the law a an important cause of the violence the drug themselves seem to take the unt of the blame inexplicably alcohol prohibition the violence that ensue and the subsequent reversal of prohibition be totally ignore by this program this program will help to perpetuate ridiculous stereotype of drug user and it be these that be the primary force in drive the very expensive and very problematic drug war the possibility of incorporate drug other than alcohol into a happy and successful life be not really touch on use of any drug in excess be probably go to cause personal problem but not all user do their drug in excess just like not all alcohol user be alcoholics if you want a point of view from someone who believe that adult have a moral right not to be incarcerate and have their life ruin by the criminal justice system just for use drug that the government for mostly very arbitrary political reason rather than reason base on sound social policy and legitimate science have decide to totally prohibit whose user it have decide to notsometaphorically wage war against just forget about it none of that be in here on the other hand this be hardly in the category of antidrug propaganda it be mostly an interesting neutrallypresented history of drug in th century united state like marijuana lsd heroin cocaine mdma and oxycontin but there be a significant element of various people point of view with regard to drug law and most but not all of that be not very thoughtful or wellinformed and slant in favor of the drug warrior mentality especially with respect to drug other than marijuana the criminal justice system along with it often harsh liferuining penalty be obviously not the only answer or the most appropriate answer to every single social problem but unfortunately theres an epidemic in this nation of an asyet unnamed disease whose primary symptom be a lack of imagination with respect to social policy when it come to certain drug a lack of compassion for fellow human a prejudice against people who use the drug that be not governmentallyapproved perhaps a vested interest in the growth of the prison policing industry and a horrid apathy with regard to human dignity it morally wrong to kidnap or incarcerate people unless you have a very damn good reason for do so and the mere possession of an arbitrarily select group of drug be clearly not such a reason this be really the primary issue when it come to drug yet this program ignore it so in sum the part of this program that neutrally present history without feed stereotype of drug user that be at the heart of the drug war mentality be pretty good and interesting and entertain but when it come to present a rational nonradical point of view with regard to drug policy and give the viewer examples not only of people with drug problem but also the many people who successfully incorporate drug into happy and successful live it pretty disappointing  n  consider this film be release year before i be bear i dont feel too bad for overlook it for such a long time back in january of though i attend the second annual quentin tarantino film fest hold in austintexas the particular theme of film this night be neglect s crime film and boy be her right the gravy train or the dion brother a it appear this print be an absolute gem wonderful performance quirky character smart plot hilarious comedy and just an all around great time rarely do you see a crime film that be so entertaining and fresh margot kidder in one of her early film appearance be extremely sexy a well i hope some cable network get a hold of this film and allow many more to see it in the meantime go to an indie video store and hope they have it  n  the movie be actually a romantic drama base on three sister who have desire to become a famous girl group in their endeavor the old sister meet a drug dealer and street hustler call satin whom sister go after because she believe he be the big time who will give her everything she ever think she want out of life though he could be accuse of kill her he really kill only her spirit and will to live after which she become a drug addict and ultimately dy from an overdose the story isnt about the street life or the italian mobster who try to buy stix off then threaten him it about how love can overcome even the bad tragedy in life a portray in song and style and the character that be the life in the time for young woman try to be discover back then  n  first i realize that a rating be suppose to be reserve for the bad of the bad this movie get that from me because a one reviewer point out it not bad in a selfaware overthetop sort of way that might allow it to have some comic or cult value it simply miss it mark on every count   contains possible spoilers   the dialog be completely disingenuous the continuity be so deliberate it painful daniel just finish speak of his lose love and with his final word the flamenco dancer start the mockshock of whats her name see i dont even remember her character name let alone the name of the forgettable actress when her husband the baldwin first tell her that her friend be the bad guy the car and the motorcycle chase do all the right thing vegetable cart go fly car crash into each other motorcycle go down the stairs people nearly be hit but remarkably no one be oh thats right     except for the one guy who have be stab several time be obviously stumble along the curb with knife wound and an approaching car apparently didnt notice him there hmmm it become more and more remarkable to me that movie like this can be make there be so much pressure in the film industry to make money youd think that someone in hollywood would think of make good film worth see now theres a novel idea my suggestion dont see this film dont rent the dvd dont watch it on cable there be lot of other thing you could be do that will leave you feel more satisfied  n  picture the scene where a bunch of scriptwriter sit around a table and one say let have a black woman approach an unsuspecting member of the public also black in the street and ask him if he be black then walk away the other writer fall about laugh hysterically until one suggest they repeat it in every episode more laughter now if you think the premise be funny and the show contain many such type of situation you will enjoy this show for the rest use your zapper and find something more entertaining like watch paint dry those that have write glowing report of this show should either get out more or be force to watch television comedy that be really funny another example of the humor in the show a girl try to get out of pay at a supermarket checkout by try to hypnotise the cashier marginally funny the first time but why repeat it over and over in different show with different cashier i could give other example but these just might be treat a spoiler divulge why this comedy just be not funny at all  n  the year saw no few than filmed production of h  g  well great novel war of the world this be perhaps the least wellknown and very probably the best of them no other version of wotw have ever attempt not only to present the story very much a well write it but also to create the atmosphere of the time in which it be suppose to take place the last year of the th century    use well original setting in and near woking england imdb seem unfriendly to what they regard a spoiler that might apply with some film where the end might actually be a surprise but with regard to one of the most famous novel in the world it seem positively silly i have no sympathy for people who have neglect to read one of the seminal work in english literature so let get right to the chase the alien be destroy through catch an earth disease against which they have no immunity if thats a spoiler so be it after a book and other film include the classic you ought to know how this ends this film which follow well plot in the main be also very cleverly present    in a way that might put many viewer off due to their ignorance of late th early th century photography although film in a widescreen aspect the film go to some length to give an impression of contemporaneity the general coloration of skin and clothes display a sepia tint often find in old photograph rather than black color be often reminiscent of handtinting at other time color be wash out these variation be typical of early film which didnt use standardized celluloid stock and therefore present a good many change in print quality even go from black white to sepia white to blue white to reddish white and so on    a youll see on occasion here the special effect be deliberately retrograde of a sort see even as late a the s    and yet the martian and their machine be very much a well describe them and have a more nearly realistic feel some of effect be really awkward    such a the destruction of big ben the acting be often more in the style of that period than ours some aspect of victorian dress may appear odd particularly the use of pomade or illiantine on head and facial hair this film be the only one that follow with some closeness well original narrative    a have be note viewer may find it informative to note plot detail that appear here that be occasionally retain in other version of the story well description of the martian    a giant head mount on numerous tentacle    be effectively portray when the martian machine appear about an hour into the film they too give a good impression of how well describe them both well and this film do an excellent job of portray the progress of the martian from the limited perspective primarily of rural england    plus a few scene in london involve the narrator other the director be unable to resist show the destruction of a major landmark big ben but at least doesnt dwell unduly on the devastation of london the victory of the martian be hardly a surprise despite the destruction by cannon of some of their machine the narrator travel about to seek escape see much of what well term the rout of mankind he encounter a curate endow with the victorian affliction of a much too precious and nervous personality they eventually find themselves on the very edge of a martian nest where they discover an awful fact the martian be show to be vampire who consume their prey alive in a very effective scene well add that after eat they set up a prolonged and cheerful hoot the narrator finally be oblige to beat senseless the increasingly hysterical curate    who revive just a the martian drag him off to the larder cheer from the gallery british curate be so often utterly insufferable  this film last almost hour go through well story in welcome detail it about time the author get his due    in a compelling presentation that build in dramatic impact a word about the act dont expect awardwinning performance theyre not bad however the actor be earnest and they grow on you most of them however have have very abeviated film career often only in this film the narrator be play by hunky anthony piana in his nd film the curate be john kaufman    also in his nd film a an actor but who have have more experience direct the brother henderson be play with some conviction by w  bernard bauman in his first film the artilleryman the only other sizable part be play by james lathrop in his first film this be overall a splendid film portray for the first time the war of the world a well write it despite it slight defect it be far and away good than any of it hypedup competitor if you want to see h  g  well war of the world    and not some wholly distorted version of it    see this film  n  of the element that make this the best at this point i have to say be christine mcintire shemps scene when poisoned and her reaction be truly magnificent i imagine that a one poster suggest christine be try to hold back laughter during that scene but it actually make her seem even more deliciously evil to be smile at shemps possibly dying another character who help this stand out be the goon his look be a great cross between horrific and comedic goofball hardly a character i would choose to meet in a dark alley or for that matter anywhere i would have prefer a bit of true whodunit mystery in this but hey when a short be this good who go to complain not i  n  okay this be stupidthey say their not make another nightmare filmthat this be the last one     and what do they do they go on make another onenot that the next one part be badbut why do they play u anyway this movie make no sense whatso everit be extremelly dullthe character be highly one dimensionalfreddy be another jokerwhich be very stupid for such a good series the plot be veryvery badand this be even bad than part and i didnt get the movieits a stupid tale in dpointless id say i hat this film so much i still rmember all the part i didnt like which be basically the whole film this be so different than the prequelsit triesand triesbut this one try the hardestand get slap back on the face again there be hadly any death scenesalthough they be differentthey suck bigtime how can they have go this far didnt they see they make the big mistake at part and yet they make this it all bout the moneydo not see this sad excuse for a nightmare series i give a nightmare on elm street six out of  good point of movie have potential with plot bad point of film terrible acting lack of deaths too funny to be classify a horror very confusing  n  everyone my name may sound weird but there be nothing else any way i havent see anything like this before so it be crazy of course thats a good thing it be a humorously interesting movie and my absolute all time favourite thing be how they intertwine other thing into one like chicken little the fish pretending to be king kong and runt the pig say twas beauty who kill the beast war of the world scene and more walt disney company have not lose his touch maybe not for this one also how they make it like they be watch a movie and it be like a home cinema however some part dont fit like in the original lion king werent timon and pumbaa with simba when he beat scar in this movie they be not they be fight the hyenas backstage thers more the reason be why pumbaa isnt so confident be because he be push away by the other animal and also it just timon timon timon anybody realise that only timonns story be tell whereas pumbaa only have flashback but apart from that it great  n  finally be there release a good modesty blaise movie which not only tell a story but actually tell the real story i admit that it be a bad movie if you expect an action thriller but if you stop in your track and remove all your expectation then you will notice that it be a story that come very close to the original make by peter odonnell you have a cover story just to tell about how modesty become the magnificent person which she be it be not a movie to attract new fan but a movie to tell the real tale some thing could have be well but when you can not forget the awful movie from then be this a magnificent movie so be you a fan then sit down relax and just enjoy that the real story be there with a cover story just to make modesty tell her story  n  by now the game stale right the joke have be do it all over the creative genius which drive this game for the first two game be go after all wrong the game be still intact the joke be here folks sure theyre all rehash but so be monkey island and for that matter the difficulty be well place somewhere between the slightly easy and the ridiculously hard the ship fight subgame be badly innappropriate in the tradition of subgames and this game have the best joke of the whole series when ask for your membership card to an exclusive beach always select you dont need to see my identification it worth the price of the game by itself  n  i decide to watch this movie because id not see carol lombard before in any movie im sorry it have to be this one because quite frankly this be a dog    and even with jimmy stewart and charles coburn both of whom be great actors the problem with the film be simple it try to put too much too quickly in to a story about a young lawyer john manson play by stewart who marry jane play by lombard within an hour of meet her whats that clich   marry in haste repent at leisure     in short the story be a series of episode that show the couple worsen financial status their trouble with john livein mother their struggle to pay the bill johns diminish status at the office the arrival of their baby son john jnr unexpected and cause additional friction at home with mother the couple angst about their marriage the baby sickness which worsen thus necessitate an heroic flight by a lone pilot in a fierce storm to ing a special serum to save the child and finally john be accept a a junior partner at the law firm how many more clich  d situation could the writer include maybe mother die soon after there wasnt much comedy the drama be lacklustre at best the dialog be painful to hear only the acting of the four main player be adequate this be the period at the end of the great depression with the usa come out of it long downturn    during which many people experience all of the event portray in the movie so it make sense for selznick to reaffirm good ol home spun american value of family relationship heroism perseverance and initiative    all against the backdrop of the average american family who well to use than jimmy stewart and carol lombard and it should be note that the film be release in early so it be plan in    soon after the usa begin to get production go for the coming world war ii hence this sort of film be a great booster for the general public at that time many of who would soon have to join england in war a many here would know hollywood and washington form an uneasy alliance before during and after the war however im glad i saw it    a a piece of disguised sociopolitical propaganda but ill have to see other lombard film to gain a good appreciation of her act range as another reviewer note see this one just to say that youve see all of stewart movie otherwise dont bother  n  unfortunately the only spoiler in this review be that there nothing to spoil about that movie even if b  mattei have never do any master piece he use to do his job with a bit of humor and craziness that make him a fun eurotrash director but for the last year he seem to have lose it this film be just empty nothing at all to wake u up from the deep sleep you sink into after the first min no sex no blood it suppose to be about snuff no actor no dialog just as bad a an t v film its even bad than his last cannibal and zombie epics so rest in peace bruno you will stay in our mind forever anyway thanks to such unforgettable gem a zombi robowarrats laltro infernovirus cruel jaw and few others so except if you want to see b mattei possess by jess franco spirit new film pas on this one but if you dont know this nice artisan career track down his old film and have fun  n  i enjoy watch this well act movie very much it be well actedparticularly by actress helen hunt and actor steven weber and jeff fahey it be a very interesting moviefilled with drama and suspensefrom the beginning to the very end i reccomend that everyone take the time to watch this make for television movieit be excellent and have great act  n  hypothetical situation abound onetime director harry ralston give u the ultimate postapocalyptic glimpse with the world dead left in the street in the store and throughout the landscape sans in the middle of a forgotten desert one lone survivor attempt to rekindle his sanity take food from the city to his bungalow in this desert all alone he hop for more but with nobody around he be leave with white underwear and a passion for a local indian tribe    until the discovery of a camera which open up new door and eaks the barrier of human coexistence alan a man of the book be leave on earth after an unknown disaster thinking he be alone he begin live life his way    until jeri ryan appear like she would in any dream out of the wood dishevel and unhappy to find the final man alive to be     well     like alan anyway they try to coexist fail get drunk and before create the ultimate dystopia they run into redneck raphael play by newcomer    dan montgomery jr bond be torn confusion set in a couple become a third wheel and the battle between physically inept nerd vs  ainless jock even with nobody leave on the planet it become a truth that even the dark of human nature will arise using a variable film technique ralston give u a mediocre story base loosely on another film entitle the quiet earth which i will be view next oddly which he never give any credit towards with a borrowed story i guess he do a decent job of reinterpret it his punch seem to be lack at the begin while ralston try to find his stride borrowing yet again from other film director technique to attempt to find his own he open the film interestingly enough but fail to answer any direct answer sure the final day have arrive but could there be a concise answer a to how or good yet why these select few survive a spookier begin would have lead u strong into a comical film the juxtaposition would have be like shawn of the dead but instead leave u feel like we be watch a madefortv program listening to the audio commentary i have respect for ralston because he work diligently to get this film make and his passion nearly sell the film but you could tell from his interaction with the cast that he wasnt a happy with his overall final product there be mistake one that he point out and others that he be ashamed to point out while this do make for decent independent filmmaking it sometimes feel cheap and in ralstons case it be the latter i must admit david arnotts portrayal of alan hook me he play that wimpy school nerd adult role very well he be funny to both watch and listen to and thus he become sympathetic to the viewer he be a key player in keep the film together ala i can not say the same for the rest this be dan montgomery first film and it be obvious    i mean    really really obvious there be scene in which i think the cue card be about to come out and read the line for him perhaps even give u a more realistic performance but alas it wasnt the case then there be jeri ryan she pull into her character near the end of the film which to me be the culmination of the entire piece of art she go from estrange unknown to bitter cranky insane girlfriend by the end confuse again she fell into her character by the end give u just a glimpse of what she could have probably do a her acting mature even a the commentary progress all that she contribute be a laugh giggle or ohhh look at that color moment while her beauty may sell ticket one may want to consider knowledge to be just as beautiful this be her first film so can i be too harsh overall this film felt like it be miss something i though the idea be strong    the premise that even with only a peppering of people remain on the earth the evil of human nature still exist jealousy can not be kill by bacteria or bomb maybe because it be consume by zinc and we a a race will always want what we can not have ralston be not a surprising director his technique be flaw and preused but he do know how to make a lowbudget comedy i think our idea of funny be different so that be why i couldnt find myself laugh at many of the bit he find hysterical his actor provide the level of act need for this film which be low than average his film be loose meaning that there be element never quite explain or tackle i e anything with wing survive which overall harm the intensity of the film this be a comedy but it could have be much darker and much much funny for those think that roger avery be a huge element to this film a we learn from their commentary all he be there for be money    the be in essence the bank for the last man dont get your hope up for any classic avery moments dont expect more from ralston    and that be how i will end it grade    out of        n  i must admit i be expect something quite different from my first viewing of cut last night though be delight with the unexpected australian horror gem i be a true horror fan as true a they come and find cut to not only be the best of the genre australia have ever produce but one of the great parody comedy film of late my only concern be that mainstream audience may not pick up on a lot of the comedic elements the film be not overly clever in it application but make me laugh at every turn try to fit in every possible cliche of the horror genre they could i be certain this be intend a humour      hoping this be intend a humour and of course there be the gore the use of the customise garden shear be illiance besides the expect stab and slash in short there be a huge amount of variety and creativity in the many violent death enough to please even the skeptic of this film worth the appearance of both kylie minogue short that her appearance be and molly ringwald be just another reason to see the film both performance be fantastic as well a simon bossell the castle in a illiant role a the jokey technician all in all i think this movie be one of the best horror product of the last couple or year as well a a beautiful satire parody toungueincheek till the very end loved it go see it  n  i be so happy not to live in an american small town because whenever im show some small town in the state it be populate with all kind of monster among whom flesh hungry zombie evil alien and sinister ghost be most harmless in this movie a former doctor who just do time for an accidental killing of his wife in a car crash direct his step to the near small town he must have never in his life see a flick about any small town which happen to be the purgatory flat and of course as soon a he arrive there all the hell eaks loose he meet a blond chick who out of all creature most resembles a cow both in facial expression and in ain functioning and at once fall in love with her but there be a tiny handicap she be already marry to a very smalltime drug dealer who in a minute get himself shot pitifully not dead to know what have come out of all this you should watch the movie for yourself ill just tell you that it slightly reminiscent of u turn by oliver stone but be a way down in all artistic property  n  like anyone else who buy this i be dupe by the piece of extreme gore and ban in country or whatever it say in the box i have to admit i be a huge gore fan and i be always amaze when film can lay it on thick and look convince do it tom savini rick baker and greg cannom be some of the best in the business the revolutionize makeup effect in the s  today you dont need them a everything be do on computer but computer can not compare to the visual wizardry that these three men could conjure up but i digress watching fantastically gory film like fulcis gate to hell or even savinis crown achievement friday the th the final chapter you can appreciate all that go into make a terrifically gory film you cant tell the difference between reality and magic i cant imagine another reason why anyone would see cannibal ferox but the gore that be ostensibly omnipotent in this film if that be the reason you seek this film then you be waste your money a many other reviewer in here have note most of the gore be an aftermath you dont see the torture or the bloodshed a it happen you see whatever it look like afterwords the gore well it here but not as much a one would hope or expect a man do get castrate and a woman do get hang by her east but other then those two scene and one involve a scalping there be nothing really much else to this film the scene of gore even in these three mentioned be still pretty tame in comparison to what you be hop for maybe it just me and my sick and twisted experience in the horror and gore genre but i be expect a bit more call me sick or twisted but isnt that the only reason people be watch this film in the first place i honestly find myself bore in a lot of places cannibal ferox be just another film that try to capitalize on a craze of a superior film while cannibal holocaust be not exactly a great film it be much good than this tripe if you go out of your way to buy this for you will feel cheated    n  i always felt that ms  merkerson have never get a role fit her skill familiar to million a the lt  on law and order she have be see in a number of theatrical release always in a supporting role hbos lackawanna blue change that and allow this talented actress to shine a nanny successful entrepreneur in a world change from segregation to integration but the story be really about the colorful array of character that she and her adopt son meet in a boarding house in lackawanna new york a suburb of buffalo the story could be set in any major africanamerican community of the s and s from atlantas sweet auburn to new york harlem but the segregationintegration angle be only a subtle undercurrent in the colorful life of the folk at nannys boarding house the story revolve around nannys relationship with all kind of people play by some of the best actor in the business i purposely do not say black actorsthis ensemble be a stunning array of talent who happen to be black except for jimmy smits of course i recommend this film a a fun and colorful look at a bygone day  n  this will not likely be vote best comedy of the year a few too many coincidence and plot hole however we be talk about a movie where a hitman and a white ead salesman become buddy so a few vagary shouldnt come a too much of a surprise brosnan be excellent in this role go be the wooden james bond a role he be waste in if he can maintain this kind of quality i hope he continue to make comedy greg kinnear be also excellent a brosnans straight man ive read a few negative comment in here about hope davis but i think she be quite good a a mousy housewife with a dark side bury deep within there be lot of good chuckle a brosnan sleazes his way through and a few scene where i nearly die laugh my father a consultant nearly lose it when julian describe himself a a facilitator much like grosse pointe blank another hitman comedy the humour can be very dark if you be in to that be prepare to enjoy yourself  n  a a casual listener of the rolling stone i think this might be interest not so a this film be very of it age in the s  to me someone bear in the s this just look to me a hippy purist propaganda crap but i be sure this film be not make for me but people who be active during th s  i expect drug galore with th stone i be disappoint it actually show real life hard work in the studio so much so i felt a if i be work with them to get to a conclusion of this god awful film i have not see any of the director other film but i suspect they follow a similar style of direct sort of amatuerish which give a feeling like the tv show eurotrash badly direct tackily put together and lack in real entertainment value my only good opinion of this be that i didnt waste money on it it come free with a sunday paper  n  watch the original with the same title from this make for tv movie be just godawful although it do use as far a i can tell almost the same dialog it just doesnt work be it the act the poor directing ok so it made for tv but why watch a bad copy when you can get your hand on the superb original especially a youll be spoil to the plot and wont enjoy the original as much a if youve watch it first there be a few thing that be different from the original it shorter for once but all be for the bad the actor play the part here just dont fit the bill you just dont believe them and who could top edward g  robinson performance from the original if you want only watch it after youve see the original and even then youll be very ave if you watch it through it almost sacrilege  n  director don siegel really impressed me with this film it be starkly shot graphic without be visually graphic wellacted by all concern and cover some of the most taboo issue of any day in a workmanlike almost expect normalcy hitherto not see in any other film by this reviewer i didnt know what to expect sit down to watch this a civil war movie or some kind of s softcore peddle with eastwood descend on a school for girl in the south but really be be neither of those thing but rather and examination exploration and descent into the soul of men and woman a dark commentary on what be at the core of the civilize a one reviewer previously note none none of the character be likable by the film end and yet each one be interest complex and enigmatic eastwood play cpl mcburney a union soldier find by young pamelyn ferdin youll recognize that voice as soon a you hear it a girl at a school for manner head by geraldine page amidst the chaos that be the civil war particularly in the south soon page teacher elizabeth hartman lovely young seductress carol and even ferdin amy have emotional sexual tie to eastwood each have their own need and secret and problem eastwood be not a nice man he play the girl off of each other always try to get the sexual advantage in the unfolding we get some real interesting thing reveal from latent lesbianism to incest the beguiled for me be a masterpiece that far exceed my expectation on every creative front this might be except for invasion of the body snatcher siegels best film it certainly be one of eastwoods best real performance page be always so very good and hartman ferdin et al excellent the gothic manse set for the school be effectively claustrophobic some of the sexuallaced scene disturb and what happen to eastwood be a leg up on much of the competition for creepy eerie demented film  n  anyone who live through the age of revenge of the nerd and girlpower will appreciate this film it be one of those film that delivers everything you want in a spring eak movie plus it make fun of the college film genre it funny it get a cast to die for amy pohler rachel dratch sophie monk parker posey jane lynch amber tamblyn missi pyle and it guaranteed to make you laugh out loud writer  actor rachel dratch be a comic genius and sophie monk be such a great villain wilson phillips omg im just repeat myself now     it will live on with girl who like miranda july but feel like eat ice cream and pretend theyre dumb  n  arguably the fine serial ever make no argument here thus far about earthman flash gordon professor zarkov and beautiful dale arden travel in a rocket ship to another universe to save the planet along the way in spellbind spectacular and actionpacked chapter flash and his friend along with new find friend such a prince barin prince thun and the awesome king vultan pool their resource together to fight the evil and army of the merciless ming of mongo and the jealous treachery of his daughter priness aura now shes a car this serial be not just a cut above most serial in term of plot act and budget it be mile ahead in these area produce by universal studio it have many former set at it disposable like the laboratory set from the bride of frankenstein and the opera house from the phantom of the opera just to name a few the production value across the board be advance in my most humble opinion for the costume wear by many of these strange men and woman be really creative and firstrate we get hawkmen shark men lion men high priest creature like dragon octasacks orangapoids and tigrons oh my and many many other fantastic thing be all of them believable and firstrate special effect no way but for most be very impressive the musical score be awesome and the chapter beginning be wellwritten lengthy enough to revitalize viewer memory of the former chapter and expertly score director frederick stephani do a great job piece everything together wonderfully and create a worthy film for alex raymonds phenom comic strip lastly the acting be pretty good in this serial all too often serial have either no name with no talent surround one or two former talent here most everyone have some ability dont get me wrong this isnt a shakespeare troupe by any mean but buster crabbe do a workmanlike likable job a flash he be ably aid by jean arden priscella lawson and the rest of the cast in general with two performer stand out but before i get to those two let me add a another reviewer note it must have be amaze for this serial to get by the hayes office i see more flesh on flash and on jean rogers and priscella lawson than in movie decade later the short crabbe and unfortunately for all of u professor zarkov frank shannon wear be about a formfitting a pair of short guy can wear the girl be wear mid drift throughout and be absolutely beautiful jean rogers may have limit acting talent but she be a blonde bombshell lawson be also very sultry and sensuous and beautiful but for me the two actor that make the serial be charles middleton a ming officious sardonic merciless and fun middleton be a class act jack tiny lipson play king vultan boisterous rouse hilarious a symbol for pure joy in life and the every essence of hedonism lipson steal each and every scene he be in the plot meander here there and everywhere but flash gordon be the penultimate serial space opera and the basis for load of science fiction to follow excellent  n  i have to say that the event of didnt hit me until i saw this documentary it take me a year to come to grip with the devastation i be the one who be change the station on the radio and channel on tv if there be any talk about the tower i be sick of hear about it when this be air on tv a year and a day later i be bawl my eye out it be the first time i have cry since the attack i highly recommend this documentary i be watch it now on tv year later and i be still cry over the tragedy the fact that this contain one of the only video shot of the first plane hit the tower be amaze it be an accident and look where it get them these two others make me want to have be there to help  n  perfect movie be rare even my favorite film tend to have flaw rear window look a little stagey at time chris elliots character in groundhog day doesnt work the music score in best year of our life be too cheesy the beginning of night of cabiria be a little too slow but this film be perfectly execute from start to finish the script be illiant the acting be superb all around although reese witherspoon and sam waterston be amaze the whole cast shin the directing and the photography be inspire and the music score be touch without be intrusive like some miramax score that be too manipulative every sad moment be truly moving every light moment make me smile this truly be one of the best film i have ever see and i wish there be more film like it i be glad that reese witherspoon have go on to stardom after this film but i be sorry to see that her recent movie be so much more escapist and silly than this serious film which be about real people real feeling and real problem brilliant a mustsee  n  this have to be one of the bad movie ever make the plot look intrigue like that of passenger but with the latter movie it somehow work a lot well the plot have be work out in the bad possible way just a few of the awful moment in the movie a flight attendant be stand in the opened doorway of a flying and try to close the door without be suck out by the mile per hour wind thereafter the land the aircraft from a few mile out start at foot thats impossible even for pilot with thousand of hour experience when on the runway perfectly straight of course she be instruct to pull on the flap huh come on flap be there to ensure lift at low speed when on the runway you use thrust reverse on the engine and give maximum power i can go on and on about little and mostly big mistake in the movie but then my reply would become the size of the english dictionary this be a movie you want to miss take my word for it  n  regardless of what anyone say it a bmovie and the effect be poorly done   if youre a vampire fanatic i suppose it would be ok not out of you others here cant sincerely mean that we be to view this a a movie not read it a a book so the effect and character be important as well a the story the story be good but it doesnt carry the film no wonder it have a low rating over all i write this because i choose to see this movie when i saw some good review here on imdb but get severely disappointed dont get me wrong i think the blade movie be awesome and love the underworld movie but this character arent close the make up on the vampire be poorly do and the effect be worse this suck i might not have get so disappointed if i have not read review here that tell me how great it be the reviewer must have have something to do with the production company or something seriously if you think this be awesome you dont care about act or make up this be well a a book out of for an ok story    n  i want very much to believe that the above quote specifically the english subtitle translation which be actually write not speak in a rejection letter a publisher send to the protagonist be mean to be selfreferential in a tongueincheek manner but if so director leos carax apparently neglect to inform the actor of the true nature of the film they be all so dreadfully earnest in their portrayal that i have to conclude carax actually take himself seriously here or else have so much disdain for everyone especially the view audience that he cant be bother let anyone in on the joke some auteur be able to get away with make oblique bizarre film because they do so with   lan and unique personal style e g david lynch and alejandro jodorowsky others use a subtler approach while still weave surreal element into the faic of the story e g krzysztof kieslowski and david cronenbergs later less bizarre work in pola x carax throw a disjointed mess at the viewer and then dare him to find fault with it well here it be the pacing be erratic and choppy in particular continuity be often dispense with superfluous character abound e g the gypsy mother and child most of the performance be overwrought the lighting be often poor particularly in the oftdiscussed sex scene unconnected scene be thrust into the film for no discernible reason and the list go on not to be completely negative it should be note that there be some uplifting exception i like the musical score even the cacophonous industrialtechno music be play in the sprawling abandon complex to which the main character retreat in the second half of the film perhaps a reference to andy warhols factory of the s much of the photography of the countryside be beautiful an obvious attempt at contrast with the grimy city setting and even well into middleage cathering deneuve show that she still have it her performance be also the only one among the major character that didnt sink into bathos there be an early time when i would regard such film a pola x more charitably experimentation be admirable even when the experiment doesnt work but carax try nothing new here the film be a pastiche of element borrow from countless earlier film and after several decade of movieviewing and literally thousand of film later i simply no longer have the patience for this kind of unoriginal poorly craft tripe at this early moment in the st century one be leave ask with the exception of jeanpierre jeunet be there  any  director in france who know how to make a watchable movie anymore rating  n  it hard to praise this film much the cgi for the dragon be well do but lack proper modelling for light and shadow also the same footage be use endlessly of the dragon stomp through corridor which become slightly tedious i be amaze to see marcus aurelius in the act credit wonder what an exemperor of the roman empire be do act in this film like whoopie goldberg it must be an alias and can one blame him for use one if he appear in this stinker the story might be interest but the acting be flat and direction be tedious if you must watch this film go around to your friend house and get drink while do so then itll be enjoyable  n  i remember go to see the movie in the summer of with my parent and be pretty into it at the time of course i be seven at the time right before the jackson movie come out my wife and i rent this movie since she have never see it and i be feel nostalgic ralph bakshi run out of money about midway through the animation process for this movie and be force to drastically cut corner on this production since this movie be do primarily with rotoscoping the animation technique for people on a budget this be say something much of this movie be animation only in the very loose sense of the word there be some scene which be very obviously just people stand in front of a screen with maybe some animation effect superimpose on top of them because of budget constraint the movie already a compression of the fellowship of the ring and part of the two tower be par down even more what you get be sort of like a filmstrip version of the cliff note of the books its not all bad though the animation ings a warmth to it that i find lack in the jackson movie it nice to imagine what it could have be like with decent funding this movie be also noteworthy for have the sequel which never come several year later a halfhearted halfhour long tv special be air which be mean to wrap thing up all i will say about that be that it be a musical  n  just finish watch ftm the trailer intrigue me so much i actually go to see it on open weekend something i never do needless to say i be very disappointed the story have so much potential and it frustrating to see it get screw up i really feel the problem with the movie be the directing and matthew mcconaughey first off i be not a mm hater i think he be awesome in both reign of fire and lone star i enjoy his performance in those movie without have to see him with his shirt off time yes we all get it that he a goodlooking guy with a nice body but i think most people know this year ago when he come on the scene in a time to kill show him with his shirt off pump iron like a sweaty madman time in the movie be totally unnecessary i think one time would have be sufficient it wouldnt surprise me if they throw those unnecessary scene in so girlfriend and wife would be willing to tag along with their significant other no woman want to see a movie about sport gamble unless         enough about that let get into his role i feel his acting be very forced and he didnt seem very comfortable i know his character be suppose to be this charming southerner but his line be corny and cheesy it be almost like he be reference day and confused line a few time in short i didnt like his character even though i be suppose to the accent his shirt off corny pick up line weak sale pitch his character be just too much of a tool a brandon or jonathan pacino and assante be great but that no surprise piven be fun to watch a arie      oooops i mean jerry i just feel this movie be very commercial and put together poorly it insulting that they could take a great story and throw in crap ingredient to try and make it a box office success cool story that appeal to the male man hunky hollywood actor for female woman make sure he have numerous scene with shirt off lift weight al pacino with great speech scene and great one liner every character shall be dress in thousand dollar suite and have an extremely dark tan jeremy piven to play the same character he do in entourage and old school throw in armand assante to seal the deal plot good writing character development and intelligent casting be unnecessarythis will be good enough for most people but not me anybody who disagree with me ask your self this would this movie be much good if a  direct by sodeberg b  decaprio or ed norton a brandon instead of mmi will probably be part of the minority in think this movie suck i realize this when the woman next to me started cry during the ridiculous end scene of pacino shed a fake tear while emacing russo the financial success of this movie will ensure one thing the movie go public get what the movie go public want big budget crapola  n  i be watch the scifi channel when this steam pile of crap come on while not as bad a wynorskis curse of the komodo this still suck     bad wynorski use the same island a in curse of the komodo as well a the same actor and house the effect be top notch suprising but thats about it           i dont know what else to say about this movie          oh yeah a in curse of the komodo the government get involve and decides to bomb the island also      when i saw this part i laugh hysterically     a komanbra part man komodo and coa overall this movie be utter crap even on bad movie standard just remember if jim wynorski have anything to do with a movie      steer clear      to avoid from fall asleep keep repeat it almost over  its almost over     out of  n  i only hear about drive lesson through the itv advert and to be honest i didnt know how much i would like it i switch on the tv last night and be totally surprised driving lesson be a modest simple film which draw you in right from the start rupert grint play the part of socially awkward teenager ben illiantly hes definitely one to look out for in the future dame eve walton be play by the fabulous julie walter i love the simple plot and the way the actor portray their character with great sensitivity the highlight of the film for me be evies rather colourful poem it show how friendship can form between the most unlikely pair in my opinion watch drive lesson be a great way to spend hour the scenery be also strike especially the countryside anyone who can call this sparkling comedy forgettable i strongly disagree with  n  for greta garbo first talk picture mgm wisely chose eugene oneills pultizer prize win play anna christie also wisely the producer back garbo up with not one but two member of the original broadway cast george marion a annas father chris and james t  mack a johnny the priest transmute to johnny the harp for film so a not to offend this little change be interest like too many film accuse by those who want movie to be movie and ignore their origin of be little more than film stage play the problem be not the play but the movie maker who wouldnt be more faithful to the property by dilute a great cinematic stage work so it wouldnt offend anyone or open it up because they could too many lose the very quality which make the piece worth film in the first place fortunately the respect the studio have for both oneill and garbo allow anna christie to survive the normally destructive process admirably in france marions generally sensitive screen adaptation wonder of wonder marion even allow the point of the scene where garbo anna reveal her past on the farm to the man she badly want to marry and the father who send her there in tact what the league of decency must have think of that the source play great problem have always be that chriss friend marthy tend to walk away with the first act and then disappears from the last two so that anna can take stage the two side of the genuinely good woman men dont always recognize the perfectly cast marie dressler who have cut her teeth on the broadway stage as well before go to hollywood be the perfect balance for garbos anna in this area as well and the fast moving film at only minute doesnt allow u too much time to miss her one of the few benefit from atmosphere be show rather than eloquently describe in the original and screenwriter marion be wise enough to stray from oneill to ing dressler back for a touching scene two third of the way through the film that will remind many of julie lavernes second act appearance in show boat anna and marthys early scene together on screen minute into the film take each others measure and set up all the tension of the rest of the story be among the most affecting scene in the entire piece not to be miss anna christie be great tragic play and a good film drama it hard to imagine that a latter day remake which would almost certainly lose the grit and atmosphere of this remake it be first film without sound in also with george marions original broadway chris could improve on this excellent film the internal scene hew closest to the play but the exterior shouldnt be miss by anyone with an eye to atmosphere while the background screen work be not to modern technical standard the background give a good glimpse than most film of the era of the actual world in which the screen play be set especially in the new york harbor  nearly all garbo naturalistic performance of the sound era have hold up superbly only the too often parodied death scene from camille year later will occasionally draw snicker because of the heavy hand direction and the parody but this anna christie together with the variety of her film mata hari and grand hotel and the sublime lubitsch touch on her comedy ninotchka garbo laugh surely stand a her best oneill fan who be take with this play at the edge of his lauded sea play should track down the fine world war ii shape film release in the year before the u s  enter the conflict the long voyage home it be almost a skillfully draw from those sea play a this one be from anna christie and feature a youngish john wayne in one of his rare nonwesterns support a fine cast of veteran actor show him the way  n  let me set the scene it be the school holiday and there be absolutely nothing at the movie i be with my friend decide what to see we look for a movie that be start soon and the grinch come up we buy ticket not know what to expect what we get be a roller coaster of fun jim carrey who may i add be my no actor in the whole world be absolutely magnificent a the grinch in this ron howards best movie next to apollo the way that this movie be make the scenery the actor the prop and the music be just amaze it really ought this childhood movie to life the story be base upon the story of the grinch a we all know the grinch be a horrible person who just cant stand christmas he live high above whoville and have never mingle well with the townfolk but one little girl be go to change the grinchs look on life and on others in a drastic way cindy lou who play by adorable new actress taylor momsem meet the grinch a find the kind part of him straight away she attempt to eak the barrier and to help the grinch move in and mingle with the town people all up this movie be a barrel of laugh for the whole family both kid and parent a solid well do jim  n  a a longtime fan of all the star trek seriesi find this a disappointing episode and i wonder if the liberal use of flashback feature will rikers exploit both positive and largely romantic and negative lot of pain and a crewmates death be a moneysaving device a be many of their bottle show episode in which all scene take place on the enterprise diana muldaur who also appear at least twice on the original series deserve a good final appearance than this for her character dr  kate pulaski loyal viewer in the star trek world be there any other kind also be shortchanged this be the last episode of second season thus the season end not with a bang but with a whimper  n  this tvseries be one of the one i love when i be a kid even though i see it now through the pinkshaded glass of nostalgia i can still tell it be a quality show very educational but still funny i have not see the original french version only the swedish i have no idea how good the dubbing be it be too long ago to remember the premise of the show be to show you how the body work i swear school still hasnt taught me half of what i know from this show it also tie in other thing like what happen if you eat unhealthy food and dont exercise with nice example within the body who want to have another bar of chocolate when you know miniature virus tank can invade you d the cartoon look nice very kid friendly of course but do with care cell viruses electric signal in the ain antibody and everything else be represent by smile cartoon figure look pretty much how youd expect what they should look like in the animated body this and the series about history especially the environmentally scary finale be key part of my childhood im so happy i find them here  n  fan of the hbo series tale from the crypt be go to love this moh episode those who know the basic archetypal story that most of the classic ec comic be base on will recognize this one right off the bat underrated indie favorite martin donovan also an excellent writer coauthor of the screenplay for apartment zero and death becomes her be the kind of guy whose everyman good look can go either way he could play a really nice if misunderstood guynextdoor or he can play the same role with a creepy undertone of corrosive sleaziness in the case of right to die he take the latter approach and it definitely works donovan be a doctor who have recently have an affair with his slutty office receptionist robin sydney much to the displeasure of his inconsolable unforgiving spouse abbey julia anderson when the two of them get involve in a terrible car accident while return from an unsuccessful weekend of make up and shes horribly burn in a fire hes reluctant to pull the plug on her not without some enthusiastic nudging from his even sleazy lawyer and best buddy corbin bernsen look the worse for wear these day but abbey never be one to give up without a fight and thats where the ectheme of the episode come in cuckolded husband and wife have always be the genre favorite subject matter for some spooky and ooky supernatural shenanigan and this case be definitely no exception if anything the rampedup quotient of sex and gore must have bill gaines cackle with glee in his mausoleum somewhere and thats not to mention that john espositos original script do give the adultery angle just a slight twist you dont realize a youre watch that you only know half the story until close to the end     think what lie beneath with more gut and gazongas and youre there not a bad effort but not the best of the lot either at least rob schmidt do display touch of flair here and there with the direction especially in a scene that make cell phone picture message into a truly horrifying experience indeed a with most moh episode this one be follow a prevalent theme this season of flaying and dismemberment so the extremely squeamish need not apply  n  dirty war be absolutely one of the best political government and well write t v drama in the years the acting be superb the writing be spectacular diry war reveal the true side of why we be not ready to respond to a nuclear biological and radiological terrorist attack here on american soil dirty war should be make into a major motion picture it that good i highly recommend this great drama to everyone who desire to know the truth this t v drama reveal how british intelligence mi mi attempt to expose a terrorist plot and conspiracy to destroy innocent victim because of england involvement in the iraq war the scene of different part of london england be also spectacular dirty war be a must see  n  some may go for a film like this but i most assuredly do not a college professor david norwell suddenly get a yen for adoption he pretty much take the first child offer a bad choice name adam a it turn out adam doesnt have both oar in the water which almost immediately cause untold stress and turmoil for dr  norwell this sob story drolly play out with one problem after another all center around adams inability and seizure why norwell want to complicate his life with an unknown factor like an adoptive child be never explain along the way the good doctor manage to attract a wifey to share in all the hell the little one be dish out personally i think both of them be one beer short of a sixpack bypass this yawner  n  this be the who at their most powerful although before the masterwork who next which would provide anthem like baba oreily and wont get fool again this film show the group in transition from mod rocker to one of the big live band of the s daltrey show what be a frontman be all about entwistle steady a ever moon be great check out the ongoing conversation with the drum tech and see him play side saddle whilst have a bass drum head replace townsend even look like he enjoy himself occasionally consider they take to the stage at be no one in the crowd be asleep there be not many band these day could produce a set as tight a this and it be difficult to imagine any of the band of today produce a concert that in year time will be be enjoy as much a this one  n  this filmmaker want to make a movie without have a story to tell and do so really awful jumble of unlikely unexplained coincidence and unidentifiable plot line all without character or clear motivation we get clich   snapshot instead of character one in particular be the diminutive and beautiful crime bos who project an overdone tough guy persona and cast a cartoonish shadow of intimidation over the actual tough guy who have be ought in to work for her nothing much startling to look at in the film except for one shot when the boy hit the road and one of them carry a tiny suitcase a in the small from a complete american tourister set in a ight sky blue without explanation or apology otherwise it standard visually one other exception be a compelling shot of a beautiful idge in ct  n  they film this movie out on long island where i grow up my other and his girlfriend be extra in this movie apparently there be some party scene where they be all drink beer which they tell me be colored water taste disgusting and be very hard to keep swallowing over and over again especially in the funnel scenes yet none of u ever heard of the movie be release anywhere in any form it never come out in the theater obviously and it as far a i knew be never release on video and im sure wasnt release on dvd yet it look like it be see by some people albeit it probably very few so there must be something i would absolutely love to purchase this for my other yet there be no way i can find it anywhere do anybody know anything about when where how this movie could be purchase and which format that would be  n  thats how burt reynolds describes this film which happen to be his best ever he play tom sharky a vice detective who on the trail of an international mobster vittorio gassman and the man hes financing to be the next governor of georgia earl holliman in the novel by william diehl the story be more complex because the guy run for president this be a very long movie that feel more like three hour instead of two the filming in downtown atlanta and the peachtree plaza hotel set the mood just right for the story reynolds doesnt do much laugh in this one compare to his comedy film he very serious here especially in the beginning of the movie because he get demote for a dope bust that go wrong at time though the movie play more like a voyeuristic drama than a crime film with burt try to get close to the mobster woman only towards the end of the film do the violence get crank up that lead to the bang bang climax just like the great jazz score in dirty harry by lalo schifrin sharkys machine feature an excellent urban jazz soundtrack with many guest star include chet baker julie london flora purim buddy de franco the manhattan transfer doc severinson sarah vaughan and joe williams al capps handle the score with magic this movie have become one of the best crime drama ever check it out score out of star  n  human traffic be a view into an average weekend for a group of friend it be a flyonthewall view into their life and mind which will show you how this group of friend relate to each other there be many moment in that every one can relate to like be out of you skull at party and talk complete rubbish to strangers the character be all people that you can relate to and they be believable in the role that they play in the movie the situation that they be in be all situation that we all have find ourselves in and that be where this film succeed the topic of sex and drug be handle superbly a to no get in the way of the character relationship with each other the story to the film be not all that but that be not a criticism this be a film about people this be a well write film with a sound track to die for d js pete tong have put together an superb selection of track for this file which all go to make this one of the best film that i have see in after watch this film i felt like i have be out party all weekend fantastic movie jo brand a the voice of reality need i say more  n  this early biograph short be so much fun to watch the second on disc one of d w  griffith year of discovery dvd set highly recommend it feature three excellent performance by the main lead and interesting to see henry b  walthall the little colonel birth of a nation a a campy musician give a countess the eye and other thing  the countess husband go berserk at his wife betrayal and have her wall into a little room with her paramour it kind of incredible that they wouldnt hear the wall go up but hey maybe the wine have something to do with it here mr  johnson father of silent player raymond hackett gesticulates wildly and this add to the melodrama but in an unexpectedly comical way the best moment come at the end a the lady pass out from shock and fear once she realize shes doom henry pick up his instrument and fan it over her the way he do it be so unexpected and in a strange way kind of sexy and i just lose it and laugh my head off the expression on his face from that moment i be charm by henry b  walthall  n  baba rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life this be the movie which cause his downfall it be release with much hype but crash badly and lay to severe financial loss for it producer and distributor rajinikanth have to personally repay them for the loss incur soon after it release he try venture into politics but fail miserably it a very bad movie with horrible act badquality makeup and pathetic screenplay throughout the movie rajinikanth look like a person suffer from some disease im one of the unfortunate soul who saw baba first day first show in theatre the audience be so bore that most of them leave the theatre before the intermission sorry ill not recommend this one to anyone  n  write by oliver stone and direct by brian de palma scarface paint a picture not easily forget al pacino turn in a stunning performance a tony montana a cuban refugee than become a powerful player in the drug world a he ruthlessly run his self make kingdom of crime in florida this gangster flick be harsh violent loud gross unpleasant and must hold the record for utter the word fk the most number of time almost three hour long and yes it can get repulsive a stout hearted constitution keep you in your seat cheer for the demise of a ruthless crime lord also play interesting character be michelle pfeiffer steven bauer robert loggia mary elizabeth mastrantonio f  murray aaham and angel salazar pacino prove to be one of the great of his generation he manage to ing reality to his character that leave a strong impression this will not be a movie for everyone for you leave think you walk away from a disaster be that powerful enough for you crime do not pay for long  n  first the cgi in this movie be horrible i watch it during a marathon of bad movie on the scifi channel at the end when the owner of the park get kill it probably one of the bad example of cgi i have even see even night of the living dead have well animation that say the movie have almost no plot why be they on that island in particular well it wasnt state in the movie and why would the people keep come into the cat area make no sense one thing that stand out in this movie be moderately good acting in what could be call a b make for tv movie movie the acting be very good parry shen stand out in particular if you have absolutely nothing to do on a saturday watch this movie it may be good for some memorable quote  n  i enjoy it there you go i say it again i even buy this movie on dvd and enjoy it a couple of more time call me old fashion but i prefer movie like this to garbage like die hard which hold up the box office and get critical acclaim just because you have some old guy save america van damme move well for a guy of his age i think deliver kick that remind one of kickboxer if you like old school action and and explosion this be the movie to watch this be one of van dammes best works van damme and steven seagal movie get release theatrically where i live so i never miss a chance to watch our old school action star on the big screen  n  what a waste of talent a very poor semicoherent script cripple this film rather unimaginative direction too some very faint echo of  fargo  here but it just doesnt come off  n  although it stray away from the book a little you cant help but love the atmospheric music and settings the scene in bath be just how they should be although if you have watch it a many time a i have you notice that the background people be the same in each scene but that aside i like the scene where they be in the hot bath but do the men and woman really bathe together like that you could see all the men perch around the outside leering at the woman it also seem strange that they all have their hat on but perhaps this be the style at the time the ballroom scene be very nice the dancing and the outfit look beautiful i especially like catherine dress in the first ballroom scene northanger abbey look suitably impose but i enjoy the bath scene better schlesinger give a good but not exceptional performance a catherine morland googie withers give the best performance a mrs allen i feel ugh peter firth a mr tilney he just talk a load of rubbish and be not a clergyman a he should be it hard to think of him be in love with catherine but then the book never really give that impression either general tilney be play reasonably well by hardy and stuart also give a sort of good performance a isabella ingrid lacey do not give a good performance a elinor tilney a for john thorpe well he give the impression of a seedy and lustful man perhaps not the character portray in the book but i quite like it i can handle scene be cut from a book adaptation but when new scene and character be add it usually annoy me the marchioness i hate her she be not part of the northanger story and neither be her cartwheeling page boy some of the script be peculiar when catherine be ask elinor tilney about her mother death she ask i suppose you saw the body how do it appear what a silly thing to say elinors calm response be stupid too anyway please tell me if you agree or disagree with me  n  mario lewis of the competitive enterprise institute have write a definitive page pointbypoint linebyline refutation of this mendacious film which

first audience pretty much a it described to have be worldwide and use actual lumiere film for most of the actuality i dont agree with other people about bad act on the british fellow part i think he be fine but the chinese lead really steal the show in any case i find myself with a smile on my face through most of the movie people who fear subtitle might note that a lot of the film be in english which for some reason be give subtitle as well a the chinese on the dvd  n  sigh im baffle when i see a short like this get attention and assignment and whatnot i saw this film at a festival before the filmmaker get any attention and forget about it immediately afterwards it be mildly annoy to see it swipe the grinch who steal christmas heart gag along with the narration the set design see many time before the whole weak tim burtonish style and the story that go nowhere and we get the joke about shoot the crow with the the first time alright but i guess whats really unacceptable be that it

to be about two men i have be wait for year for a good oldfashioned romance between two men latter day be all that and more yes it be soapy melodramatic clich  ridden and quite corny that be what make it so wonderful there be nothing like a good romantic movie and this movie be romantic in the best sense of the word as to the issue of religion sorry folk but these thing do happen and be happen to gay people even now it be not just the mormon church that reject it gay member gay people in every religion have face harsh judgment and rejection i love this movie it have a perfect blend of a fantasyromance ground in the reality of the daytoday life of the character if i could give it more than ten star i would good love story never go out of style great love story like latter day be unforgettable its about time  n  the concept of have laurel hardy this time in the role of chimney sweeper work out surprisingly hilarious it guarantee some funny situation and silly antic from especially stan laurel of course a usual the movie also have a subplot with a nutty professor who be work on a rejuvenation formula it doesnt really sound like a logical mix of story line and incoherent but both plot line blend in perfectly toward the memorable end it still a bit weird but it funny nevertheless so it work for the movie the support cast of the movie be surprising good sam adam be great a the stereotypical butler and lucien littlefield go deliciously overthetop a the nutty professor the movie be fill with some excellent time and hilarious construct sequence which be all quite predictable but become hilarious to watch nevertheless thanks to the way they be all execute it all help to make dirty work to be one of the good laurel hardy shorts    n  this movie come a a huge disappointment the anime series end with a relatively stupid plot twist and the rushed introduction of a pretty lame villain but i expect shamballa to tie up all the loose end unfortunately it didnt it add more plot hole than it resolve and confuse more than it clarify the animation and voice act be great but with an idiotic plot dull set most of the movie doesnt even take place in dull wwii earth rather than the alchemy world and disappointing end ed be useless for the rest of his day in a world with no alchemy and he ditch winry it be altogether pretty lackluster do yourself a favor disregard the last half of the anime as well a this movie and read the manga  n  maybe i love this movie so much in part because ive be feel down in the dump and it such a lovely little fairytale whatever the reason i think it be pitch perfect great intelligent story beautiful effect excellent act especially de niro who be awesome this movie make me happy than ive be for a while it be a very funny and clever movie the run joke of the kingdom history of prince savagery and the aftermath the way indulge in magic effect the witch and dozen of smart little touch all keep me enthral thats much of what make it so good it an elaborate specialeffectsladen movie with more story than most fairytale movie yet there be an incredible attention to small things i feel like just go ahead and watch it all over again  n  i be surprise that forgive the franklin do not generate more buzz at this year sundance film festival there be time that the laughter at the screening i saw be so loud that you could barely hear the movie the movie have some excellent acting and a story that really make one examine oader issue you know little issue like religion sex and the truth lot of comedy seem to rely on the same old corny contrive situation many leave you think i know they rip this off from some sitcom  this film take off on it own unique direction i really think that jay floyd do a fantastic job with a tight budget on this film  n  they must issue this plot outline to all wannabe filmmaker arrive at the hollywood bus station they then fill in the blank and set their story in whatever hick town or urban ghetto from which they just arrive you know exactly what this movie be about from the opening shot four young boy play in grainy slow motion accompany by voice over narration next stop after the bus station must be to buy stock footage of four young boy play in grainy slow motion once theyre grow it easy to spot the writer director among the four he the quiet contemplative longhaired one who be never see without his composition book tuck in his pant this mean that his superb write talent will be his ticket from hickville to hollywood only theres no writing or direct talent on display here and if you still cant figure out which one he be heres a hint the auteur and his character have the same middle name it take over an hour to figure out that these twentysomething men be suppose to still be in high school what look like a prison be apparently a high school the warden turn out to be the principal once more the poor misunderstood rebel can pound everyone in the movie into the pavement murder and pillage but be powerless to stand up to his alcoholic father how about hit back kid like you do everyone else numerous fist fight scene for no apparent purpose howlingly bad dialogue many scene badly out of focus cartoon character keep pop up a bit player and extra draw unintentional laugh from the premiere audience overact in the extreme and if you dont quite get the selfimportant speech or the slowmotion scenes just listen to the overbear music it will clue you in and what youre suppose to feel poor marisa ryan must be rack up lot of frequent flier mileage a she travel around the country work in these amateur regional film the big sin be that the audience be suppose to feel sympathy for kid who gun down old lady run over puppy chain to a tree rob and steal all the while complain about their sad sorry life but if only we could get out of this hick town and go to college yeah thats the ticket why be it that every twentysomething filmmaker believe that his life so far be so important so interesting that the world cant wait to see it onscreen if this movie be as autobiographical a it seem then the auteur well be look over his shoulder for policeman bear fugitive warrant  n  i watch this movie so that you dont have to i have great respect for kris kristofferson but what be he think he do this for scale at least the films title practice truth in advertising since people and object routinely disappear throughout the film add to the confusion kristofferson mention this in his commentary that even he wasnt sure if genevieve bujolds character really exist this do not bode well for the viewer be able to follow the story the making of feature be far more interesting than the movie itself it explore the difficulty cobble together fund for an indie even a the film be be shot to it credit this movie be visually pleasing and doesnt in any way look like a movie make with just slightly over m  too bad the money wasnt spend on a good project  n  just saw this movie on open night i read some other user comment which convince me to go see it     i must say i be not impressed im so unimpressed that i feel the need to write this comment to spare some of you people some money first of all the messenger be very predictable and just not much of a thriller it might be scary for someone under but it really do nothing for me the climax be laughable and most of the audience leave before the movie resolution furthermore the acting seem a little superficial some of the emotional argument between the family be less convince than the subpar suspense scenes if youve see preview for this movie then youve see most of the best part and have a strong understanding of the plot this movie be not worth see in the theater  n  i go to see this movie actually i go to see family portrait which contain cut moment other short film by douglas buck at the mar del plata festival argentina     i just couldnt watch it i have to cover my eye after the st half of cut moment and take a peek every once in a while by the time it be over my stomach be upside down and i felt light head i just have to leave the cinema a few minute after the nd short begin btw of course i be not the only one who leave the room it be waaaay too violent and disgust for me i be impress by the many ave people who actually love it i just dont get how you can love that kind of movie the shocking and bloody and horrible image i saw get really stick in my head for like two day i also try to analyze the story my boyfriend do see the whole thing and tell me about it and i just dont think it make any sense i mean that amount of violence and stuff make no other sense than to try to shock people and thats not a good enough reason i think there absolutely nothing in this movie that i can say well at least x thing about it be good but well i guess i will never understand that kind of film  n  a wellmade runofthemill movie with a tragic end pluses the way the story move begin with soorya struggle to live follow by a long flashback about why he there the music a disinterested look at the life of policeman minuses the violence and the gore but i guess they add to the realistic effect still have people head chop off and send in box and sack could have be avoided no complaint  n  i dont understand the positive comment make about this film it be cheap and nasty on all level and i can not understand how it ever get made cartoon character abound sue foulmouthed alcoholic layabout irish father be a prime example none of the character be remotely sympathetic except iefly for sue asian boyfriend but even he then turn out to be capable of domestic violence a desperately unattractive a they both be ive no idea why either rita and or sue would throw themselves at a consummate creep like bob but give that they do why should i be expect to care what happen to them so many review keep carp on about how realistic it be if that be true it be a sad reflection on society but no reason to put it on film i didnt like the film at all  n  steven what have you do you have hit an all new low it be weird since stevens last film shadow man be direct by the same director who do this trash shadow man be good this be diabolically bad so bad it wasnt even funny steven be hardly in the movie and feel like he be in a cameo appearance and when he be in the film he be dub half the time anyway a for the action well let just say the wizard of oz have more action than this trash there be hardly any action in the film and when it do finally arrive it be bore depress badly shoot so call action scene seagal hardly kill anyone unlike his over film where he go one man army ie under siege and and exit wound the plot be so confusing with so many plot hole that it doesnt make scene sometimes flight of fury well be good what a shame i waste pound on this garbage out of ten good luck next time  n  a callgirl witness a murder and become the killer next target director brian de palma be really on a pretentious roll here his camera swoop around corner in a museum after linger a long time over a painting of an ape divvies up into split screen for arty purpose practically give away his plot with a sequence again in split screen where two character be both watch a tv program about transsexual and stag his first finale during a thunderous rainstorm dress to kill be exhaust primarily because it ask u to swallow so much and give back nothing substantial much of the act with the exception of young keith gordon be mediocre and the second finale be a ripoff of de palmas own carrienot to mention psycho the explanation of the dirty deeds play like a spoof of hitchcock not an homage stylish in a steely cold way the end result be distinctly halfbaked    from       n   flat spoilers  five med student nelson kiefer sutherland david laaccio kevin bacon rachel mannus julia roberts joe hurley william baldwin randy steckle oliver platt decide to attempt an experiment die for exactly minute it be the maximum amount of time somebody can do this before be risk of ain damage  almost everyone do this experiment randy be the lone

screen rachel relive her father suicide and nelson face a little boy with murderous intentions why be they here and how will they get rid of them this tense and interesting movie set in an hallucinated city and into a gothic med school be quite the experience both for the story and the character play by thenbudding star such a kiefer sutherland julia roberts oliver platt kevin bacon and william baldwin the director be joel schumacher who have already work with sutherland in lose boy and this second cooperation be even good than the first a must for psychologicalthrillerhorror bud and metaphor lover this story be about forgiveness and righting of past wrong this be one of the minor classic from the s that get respect even today like the mention by rebecca gayheart in scream or the tru call episode which use the movie premise flatliners  n  one of my favorite show back in the s  a i recall it go to air on friday or possibly saturday night on the nine network here in australia darren mcgavin and simon oakland be great together each episode usually reach a climax with kolchack have to engage in hand to hand combat with some sort of supernatural opponent to their credit the writer make a concerted effort to get away from the usual round of vampire and ghost as much a possible i remember one episode in which the adversary be the spirit of an ancient indian chief which who come back a a massive electrical current which start to kill people in a city hospital the final showdown saw kolchack try to short circuit the power beast amidst an explosion of spark and billow flame oh well     you have to be there at the time but it be an interesting idea mcgavin always pack a lot of energy and enthusiasm into his role and this be one of his best definitely deserve a place in tvs hall of fame to quote tony vincenzo     kolchack you be on it     or in the case of the hall of famein it  n  i think my summary say it all this mtvish answer to the classic candid camera tv show feature a gen x or be that gen y type put in false chopper and wear various hat and wig and glass and set people up in fairly outlandish although often not very interesting situation example kennedy have a guy invite his parent to his wedding kennedy be the ide do up in a full idal gown and long wig the joke be that the parent immediately understand their son be marry a man who claim to no longer have his bit and piece problem be this schtick go on way too long obviously to fill out time and kennedy be about as funny a a dead cod lie in the sun candid camera would have run three or four scenario in the time it take kennedy to get through this one run around constantly ask do i look fat i recognize the show be not make for me it be make for yearold pinhead who think jackass be the height of comedy today so let them laugh thank god the show be shortlived  n  frownland be like one of those intensely embarrassing situation where you end up laugh out loud at exactly the wrong time and just at the moment you realize you shouldnt be laugh youve already reach the pinnacle of voice resoundness and a you look around you at the ghostly white face with their gaping wideopen mouth and glazen eye you feel a piercing ache begin in the pit of your stomach and suddenly rush up your throat and     well you get the point but for all it unpleasantness and punch in the face frownland really be a remarkable piece of work that after view the inarticulate mess of a main character and all his pathetic trouble and mishap make you want to scratch your own eye out and at the same time you feel sickenly sorry for him it would have be a lot easy for me to simply walk out of ronald bronsteins film but for some insane reason i felt an unwavering determination to stay the course and experience all the grainy irritation the film have to offer if someone set you on fire you typically want to put it out stop drop and roll but with this film you want to watch the flame slowly engulf your entire body you endure the painperhaps out of spite or some unknown masochistic curiosity i cant even begin to attempt to explain unfortunately mainstream cinema will never let this film come to a theater near you but if you get a chance to catch it prepare yourself ing a doggie bag  n  i saw this movie while surf through infomercial and latenight s sitcom on tv one night at in the morning i must say i didnt expect much and i didnt get much although rise mcgowan be hot her performance and the performance of the rest of the cast be not oscarworthy to say the least this movie have it ups and down and do have a nice couple of twist at the end but in all honesty it be awful not even a typical slasher movie no gore no sex no nudity no real violence just bad act id give it a out of  n  i first saw this film when i be about year old on tv in the uk where it be call laupta the fly island i absolutely love it and be heartoken when it be repeat a while later and i miss it i be enchant by the story and character but most of all by the haunting and beautiful music it would have be the original english dub version which i saw sometimes erroneously refer to a the streamline dub the dub be actually by ghibli themselves and only distribute by streamline which be sadly unavailable except a part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc boxset unfortunately i feel that the release have be partly spoil by disney the voice acting be ok but the dialogue doesnt have the same raw energy that the streamline dub or the original japanese have and i think james van der beek sound too old to play the lead they have make some pointless alteration such a change the main character name from pazu to patzu and add some dialogue but bad of all i feel that they have ruin many scene with intrusive music the opening scene of the airship for example be originally silent but have be spoil thanks to disneys moronic requirement that there be music play whenever anyone be not speak which i find annoy in many disney films this film still blow away most recent animated film and i can not recommend it highly enough the plot be simple yet captivate and the film show a flair which be sadly miss from most modern massmarket homogenize animation  n  this film cant make up it mind whether it message be human be evil and bad and animal be sweet and blameless or dont ever go in the water again a fisherman nolan be out to nab a killer whale a very bad thing but when he accidentally accidentally mark you hit a pregnant cow instead of her mate the cow and i use the word in all sens who be obviously a sick psychobitch and the canonical villain of the piece throw herself against the propeller try to chew herself to bit in the most distressing and hideous not to mention ineffectual method of kill herself i doubt it be her first when her unborn fetus abort from her hideous selfinflicted wound her mate go mental with revenge and swears to hurt kill and mutilate every human who even so much a talk to nolan obviously a among human total psycho date other total psychos the film reek of halfthought out antihuman message the poor poor whale the evil men must suffer and die and yet it do not succeed in demonize nolan at all it true that when he set out his motif be selfish and cruel but at the first squeal of the first whale he grow a heart and a the film progress he grow more and more compassionate to the whale pain until it seem he will walk out on the ice and give himself to the whale just to make it feel a little better the film final journey in which nolan follow the whale on a bizarre journey to the north remind me of melville eerie manwhale connection and for a moment hint at a truly interesting conclusion where these two husband might connect understand even respect each other in their own grief for nolan lose his wife and unborn child also to an accident it clear nolan respect the whale and feel for it loss however it never go there the whalecharacter have no compassion or respect for anyone the final scene lose this focus and become jawslike where the seamonster finally kill everybody and nolan and nodoubt through an oversight fail to chomp up the whalehugger tho he make a good snap for her head a little early i love animal and i detest whale and what be more i love orca whale but if this films goal be to make me feel that the whale be the victim and that people be evil and detestable it completely fail nolan show compassion and growth and feel for others and all the whale think about be kill and maiming the only message one can walk away with be if you see an orca whale ever anywhere run the other way cause if you step on his fin the wrong way he will hunt you to the end of the earth destroy everything around you  n  why o why     do i pick this one up well     i need a noainer in the summer heat and the cover look cool of course i shouldve know well this be a really really bad movie and it get embarasing when the maker know it bad and try cover it up by add some sexy beautiful woman and some sexscenes to it well folk     it doesnt cut it do it if you would like a cool movie about a big reptile that be actually very very good wellplayed and funny go rent lake placid that be an order  n  only a very small child could overlook the absurdity in this bomb the first difficulty face by the submarine seaview be what appear to be chunk ofrock fall down through the water and crash into it hull but it not rock theyre under the north poleit be ice everybody except possibly hitherto mention small child and even some of them know that ice floats then disaster strikesthat darn van allen radiation belt around the earth catch fire no one know how this happen we be told which be understandable because it be utterly impossible for radiation to catch fire and even if it could there be no air in space for it to burn there be literally no good reason to overlook science concept basic to nd grade school textbook when make a film however irwin allen manages to do it again and again perhaps we be mean to focus on the people instead which be pretty easy a they be cardboard the cast try very hard not to look embarrass in this ridiculous subkiddie romp much like late episode of his lose in space tv series the concept of which be swipe outright from writer ib melchior and then rush into production the sub look pretty good though which be why this one get a  n  our teacher show u this movie in first grade i havent see it since i just watch the trailer though do this look like a first grade movie to you i dont think so i be so horrify by this movie i could barely watch it it be mainly the scene with shirley mcclain cut that little girl in half and then there be the boy with ketchup i be freak out by this film now today be i probably would not feel that way i just want to share my experience and opinion that maybe small child shouldnt see this movie even though it pg be aware of the possible outcome of show this to kid i dont even remember what it be about once be enough  n  a plot that fizzle and reek of irreconcilable difference in opinion constitute a judgmental havoc with one side prolife and the other a destroyer of a demon seed the horror be leave out and replace with an overall dull effect quite possibly mean to be horrific but instead demonstrate an ill dose of belief which ridicule each other to death despite the title itself be a fan of master of horror since the beginning this ridiculous plot twist with it sordid depiction crash apart like a spindly old rock chair after be sat upon i view this episode a be throw together from the get go never really take off anywhere other than to see it through for what it worth and relieve when it finally come to the end    n  scott menville be not casey kasem that be the first most important and most disturbing thing about this attempt at reimagining scoobydoo and company shaggys voice be squeaky and do not sound anything like he have ever sound in any of the previous incarnation of the scooby show theyve also change the outfit and the classic mode of walk from the original im not sure what theyre on about yet with the villain angle but it surely isnt follow the formula use in any of the previous scooby shows and the animation style be very bizarre and distort i like it but it not real scoobydoo type animation but the weird animation use for other wb show grow on me this might too its worth a glance at once if you can handle the lack of proper shaggy voice that right there be enough to jar one out of enjoy the show properly besides i be try not to be an inflexible nitpicking fan evolve or die a the saying go well see how it look after two more episode by then ill have form a much more solid opinion  n  i often wonder how movie like this even get make and the most shocking part be that people actually pay to watch them with aksar it appear a though the director make up the story a he go along add twist and turn when he like no matter how ludicrous they be the script be non existent with inane dialog such a jo sheena roy pehenti hai wahee fashion hota hai and yeh versace hai madam yeah right  every one of the character be shallow and underdeveloped acting be awful constumes lycra for udita and awful suit for a stocky emran locales the numerous house that be use for interior do not even vaguely resemble a victorian mansion screenplay etc etc just one word rubbish for those people who love hashmi and his movie watch it a for me ill never get those two and a half hour back the only redeeming factor be some of the music which be decent  n  this movie be an amazing comedy   the script be too funny   if u watch it more than once you will enjoy it more though the comedy at time be silly but it really make u laugh salman khan and aamir khan have give justice to their role after i have not come across any hindi movie which be as funny a this  n  even this early in his career capra be quite accomplish with his camerawork and his timing this be a thin story and quite predictable at time but he get very good performance out of his cast and have some rather intricate camera move that involve the viewer intimately the first part look like a cinderella story though anyone with ains can see that the bottom will fall out of that the rich prince will lose his fortune nonetheless because of his good cast and fast pace it easy to get catch up in the clich  s then the movie do become more original a the married couple have to find a way to make a live the end be very predictable but satisfy i also want to compliment the titlewriting very witty and fun  n  uwe boll slip back in his filmmaking skill once again to offer up a scifi horror tale of mercenary and reporter take on super soldier on a remote island an okay cast head by the excellent udo keir be cast adrift by boll who make the bad of script that should have work the mad scientist be investigate by a reporter have be do to death but this script be amuse enough that the plot should have work additionally the effect and super soldier design with their dead lifeless eye have some degree of creepiness however boll somehow manage to film everything in an off hand way it a if he couldnt be bother to actually figure out what would work and instead rattle off stock camera placement and walk away additionally the assembly of scene have no spark or life im guess that boll only shoot one or two take and just use what he have it really stink clearly boll be in one of his periodic retrograde film where anything hes ever learn about film get flush the last film he make that be this bad be seed a serial killer movie that be one of the bad film ive ever see this isnt that bad but it be close simply because it should have be well then again udo keir be good enough that he do make watch his scene worth the effort and make this a an almost so bad it good film id take a pas unless it late at night and youre catch it on cable  n  this video be so hilariously funny it make everything elseby eddie murphy seem very disappointing even beverly hill cop and the nutty professor which just go to show you how good this really be to be honest i dont think that ive everlaughed at something as much a this include naked gun and the rarely see bargearse this show be amazing although it must be say that it be certainly fill with the word begin with f that be four letter long plus it extended version begin with m but it didnt bother me see it the funny thing ive ever see and probably the funny you ever have too  n  this film be dreadful it have absolutely zero laugh heew hammer adam goldberg set out to save hannukah from evil santa andy dick perhaps a promising enough basis for a plot in actual fact the film do not progress beyond this premise while there be some far and few nice touch and the plot be relatively coherent it be labour hackneyed and ultimately mindlessly bore this despite the fact that goldberg dick and greer hammer client love interest all have quite considerable screen presence despite be play for what might be describe a whacky overthetop gag this film be consistently middleclass middleoftheroad muck do not waste minute of your life on this note the music be good    n  it amaze that such a clicheridden yuppie angst film actually get make in the first place the character be so weak and the act so uninspired that it impossible to care about any of them especially brooke shield the temptation to fast forward through the slow part be almost irresistible if you like this genre youd be good off rent single or body rest motion  n  i never watch the next action hero show and until read the other comment here do not know that this movie be the prize from that competition i be just flipping channel and come across this and find myself watch dare eagerly all the way to the end yes the plot be do the most dangerous game etc but i be hop for and almost receive the gotcha how the protagonist be go to beat the hunter in the end i think the hightech be overdone gps and give me coldsweat flashback of night rider but it nevertheless be not too overdone the basic problem i have with this movie be the degree of sod suspension of disbelief that be require of the viewer do we really think that someone fly in a helicopter could lob countless incendiary grenade at a public idge and no cop show up to investigate could a limousine do countless donuts in a la vega intersection and no cop show up pleeease way too much of that type of thing fun to watch but keep it at least plausible thank you very much the final solution be good but the end be disappoint with the after taste of a bad star trek episode at least now i understand why the acting be so cheesy except for zane who doesnt get near as much work a he deserve imho they be winner from a reality show knock me out  n  i be a big fan of old horror movie and since i be middle age old to me be a movie make before with most be make in the s to s period i be not a big fan of more modern horror movie with one exception be creepshow which i think be great i could reminisce about the story there but i really really enjoy the monster in the box story with hal holook and also the one about the really clean guy be a great end all the story be great though so why do i like them so much the character have some decent development the line be very plain about who be good and who be bad the horror bit be heighten with a close up of a face aghast with fear and the funny bit be really funny this sequel be either greatly lacking of these element or they be totally absent i be write this only have watch it partially because the movie be a complete waste of time and i turn it off to do other thing like write movie review on imdb com lol when george kennedy and an old dorothy lamoure get top billing it tell you something        of also romeros expertise be hard to find here they must have tell him to tone it down to a pg standard i dont know what this be rat at but it look pg to me and thats not a good thing for a movie with nothing else go on it show on the encore cable channel if your die yuck yuck to see it  n  i just want to say that i love gheorghe muresan so i automatically love this movie everything else about it be soso     billy crystal be a good actor even if he be annoy but the thing that make this movie be at least for a basketball fan see gheorghe muresan act  n  i think that this movie be incredible i absolutely love it even though my others didnt that much the special effect be outstanding and this movie be about my favorite sport golf the only thing that be disappoint about this amazing movie be that it be hard to watch two time or more in a row this movie just absolutely tops everything else i have ever see it be everything i would expect out of a movie i just love it also it be pretty kidfriendly this movie help me realize that when you put your mind to it anything be possible i would give it a pure it be well than the legend of baggar vants and the two pirate of the caribbean movie combine absolutely amaze love it  n  this be a funny film and i like it a lot cary elwes play robin hood to a tee this be of course the usual good v evil with robin against the evil sheriff of nottingham the humor be sort of in your face stuff for the most part but still work well a comedy for a night when you dont want to have to think much it well worth a rent  n  some here have comment that this be the bad elvis movie ever make well they be only partly right for me this be the bad movie ever make period i have never see anything so basely crude and insulting and vile and against human nature a this film a true embarrassment to the motion picture industry this isnt even so bad it good there be no campy trashy fun to be have here like in some of elvis other bad movie like clambake this one be so rotten to sit through it painful pure garbage native american should sue for their poor clich  d and stereotypical treatment here actually perhaps all human being should sue for the crime and disservice this movie do to the specie a a whole star seriously grade f  n  first of all yes im white so i try to tread lightly in the ever delicate subject of race     anyway     white people hat black people bad but black people hat white people ok because apparently we deserve it where do i start i wish i have something good to say about this movie aside unintended comedy scenes the infamous scene be ice cube and co  get in a fight with some really big really strong really really angry and scary look neonazis and win the neonazi where twice the size and the chase the chase be priceless     this be not a movie about race tolerance and understand it doesnt deliver     this be a racist movie that reaffirm all the clich   stereotype the white wimpy guy who get manhandle by his black roommate automatically transform in a skinhead     cmon simply awful i do regret ever see it save your time and the dreadful experience of a poorly write poorly act dull and clearly biased picture if you be into the subject go and rent american history x now thats a movie  n  donald pleasance and peter cushing unite in one horror film that always sound like a terrific plan two of the most versatile cult actor of their generation who previously already star together in terrific genre outing like the flesh and the fiend and from beyond the grave pair up in a mids satanic theme exploitation flick how can this possibly go wrong well unfortunately it can to my deepest regret land of the minotaur can hardly even be call mediocre and that in spite of the cast the exotic set the appeal title and the potentially great sound premise in a remote little area in greece more particularly near an archaeological site multiple tourist vanish because baron peter cushing and his docile follower keep feed them to a fireeathing minotaur statue cushing who never look more bored and uninterested in any role he play before own a giant medieval castle and apparently in greek this mean you also own the complementary archaeological ruin and an underground network of cavern that be of course quite handy if your hobby be the kidnapping of random camper and amateur archaeologist when three of his young friend also mysteriously disappear in the same area father roch the priest of a couple of town before decides to investigate land of the minotaur be a boring and extremely slowpaced horror effort that never really undertake any major attempt to generate a satanic atmosphere and doesnt bother to elaborate on all the potentially fascinating element and pagan trivia detail the titular minotaur for example be an intriguing creature of greek mythology with the head of a bull and the body of a person but for some inexplicable reason the script never deepen out the significance instead the film focus on tedious and overly talkative sequence and loud inappropriate music alter with experimental noise the only reason to even consider give this major disappointment of a film a chance be because of donald pleasance his portrayal of rude bossy and oldfashioned priest who criticize everything that represent modern youth be powerful and reliable a always  n  the three short include on this compilation issue in be timeless chaplin classic nothing wrong with them and nothing to criticize either chaplin score for these film and the framework add a idging section between the short be also well do the problem with this compilation be a minor one yet annoy the short have be stretchprinted to fit the frame p s speed of contemporary film whereas the short themselves where shot at frame p s this result be jerky motion that doesnt look very attractive and yet this be an excusable solution give the limitation of optical printing technology at the time it just not excusable that the current dvd version be unrestored the film look dirty a they do in and be still stretch print there be separate restored version of these classic available even on dvd and it would not be a problem to restore the image but ala this have not be done a minor quibble have take up a lot of space in my article but i say again a minor quibble it should not detract all that much from the experience although it detract one point from my rating the short be still worth  n  s tourist trap be a clever unique b thriller that stand out a one of the best of it kind travellers stop at a lonely wax museum where the owner mannequin be a little too lifelike for comfort while the film have hint of the texas chainsaw massacre tourist trap be mainly a creepy psychological thriller worthy of the twilight zone director david schmoeller give this movie an atmosphere of darkness and mystery that reach nightmarish proportion also schmoelloer add the occasional touch of comic relief to the bizarre happenings venteran actor chuck connors be the best of the film decent cast pino donaggios music score be excellent have both lyrical and solemn theme that be perfect to the movie a number of the film sequence be quite memorable for horror and thriller fan alike tourist trap be an unforgettable mustsee film     out of       n  year ago i saw the godfather and it make a lasting impression on me the atmosphere of the movie be first class the act memorable and the storyline a classic recently i buy the trilogy and after watch part again i look eagerly to view part         i be so pleased to realize early on into part that here be a fitting follow on to the great godfather movie again everything be just about perfect and i could not wait to see godfather iii            wrong i wish id stop at ii the storyline be not good it seem to me like a story make up just to have a story the character be weak especially the daughter pacinos protege be a weak character that would have be eat alive in godfather or then scene such a corleone be invest with all the trapping of the catholic church with full choir the assassin on horseback rid away into the sunset the unseen helicopter machine gunning of the meeting where the goody get away and everyone else be shot daughter and st cousin roll bit of pasta across a board the pathetic shooting on the step        corleone stuff sweet down him with orange juice for diabetes a man of his intelligence and guile isnt ready for an emergency     no it be not good and with the best will in the world i wont be able to watch it again but ill watch many time down the year  n  this little twoperson movie be actually much big than it look it have so many layer ive watch it over and over and always pick up on something new i be amaze at the depth of the acting and i feel if this movie have get wider release that there would be no question that alan rickman be a major star  n  uk newspaper review seem to have concentrate on the fact that the reviewer tend to know toby young the journalist on whose reallife experience this movie be base the key word here be base how to lose friend be a fictitious romcom sidney young join a prestigious gossip magazine in new york where he proceed to make gaffe after gaffe before finally get it right and make it this involve him sell out and the movie have some serious point to make about journalistic integrity however they be not overdone the main substance remain a comedy which centre around sidney misadventures the script have it cake and eat it in that sidney be a stupid wellmeaning buffoon at the same time a be a smart moderately obnoxious skilled writer this contradiction be never that much of an issue because simon pegg a sidney project likability too well jeff bridge underplay sidney editor a little too effectively and kirsten dunst be rather anonymous a the conflicted eventual object of sidneys affection and with regard to megan fox who play an airhead bimbo starlet i can say only this just say the word miss fox and i will leave my wife sell all my belonging and buy myself a plane ticket in order to take my place at your side a your consort of course give that im a fat yearold english accountant you might not find my offer too entice but it there on the table anyway give how short her career have be so far one might think it be a little too soon for megan fox to take on a role which mercilessly lampoon the sort of actress she might be think to become however she do it sweetly with some skill and extremely sexily this girl will go far there be stalwart support from a variety of seasoned performer miriam margolyes and bill paterson from the uk gillian anderson and danny huston from the us there be several laughoutloud moment and i smile most of the way through a ever the fword make appearance when it really doesnt need to although at least a couple of these be very funny  n  alien hunter out of be it me or do every movie that start in roswell new mexico suck take alien mixed with the thing mixed with contact mixed with of all thing on the beach the andromeda strain the classroom scene from raider of the lose ark and a throw in a little stargate to boot derivative doesnt even begin to describe this movie of course with nothing original plot wise they amp up the gore and sex right nope gore be a blink and you miss it affair and sex be all tease james spader causally mention he need a shower and the delectable leslie stefanson ask to join him   he turn her down aggh in fact if a movie ever need a shower scene to liven thing up this be it i mean if your go to have impossibly goodlooking woman in white bathing suit wander around an antarctica research base why not go for oke with about second of actual thrill in the entire movie alien hunter be remarkable serious and slow go for a scifi adventure need a much good plot twist to liven it up and by the way the alien itself be a horribly clich  d artifice and have virtually no screen time for someone who share half the title i also inquire during view what be with the child of the corn in space motif note that since jason of friday the th fame pinhead from hellraiser and that leprechaun have all travel to space to slay nubile teenager why not the cornfield the character in the cornfield dress like logan run extras and i be just wait for the stalk to come alive and attack them that however would have be excite and apparently against this movie covenant the acting be mostly fine a spader reprise his stargate role while stefanson and janine eser model the late in antarctic beachwear john lynch however read the whole script and act the like the insane bad guy well before the story would indicate it alien hunter be a disappointing derivative slog that make me pine for a proper child of the corn in space movie  n  i have a hard time put into word just how wonderful this be once in a while you see a film that just stick with you you be alone be that movie for me the film be constantly in my head and in my heart i replay the scene mentally every day and analyze them and go through the emotion all over again a if i be see it for the first time there be nothing i do not like about the movie amazing soundtrack the end be perfect very emotionally stir it be compel and riveting i adore jessica bohl and her performance be the great i have ever witness i admire brittanys strength what a strong woman  the tag line be when your dark moment come to life we never know what we be capable of do everyone say oh i would never do that when really we have no idea what we would do in a situation we be very capable of anything and this movie delve straight into that subject the honesty of the movie may be my absolute favorite part thank you gorman becherd for a perfect piece of art  n  i love this young people trap in a house of horror movie not just because im a huge linnea quigleyjill terashita fan but because it be a lot of fun and actually scary at times the special effect be awesome especially linneas scene with the lipstick and towards the end when almost everyone be dead and possessed plenty of nudity provide by linnea and jill plenty of humor cool soundtrack high body count etc     by the way if you have never see this one try and buy watch the unrated version which have more gore and some scene the rat version be miss  n  i saw the film and i get screw because the film be foolish and boring i think ram gopal varma will justify his work but unfortunately he fail and the whole film get spoil and they spoil sholay the cast and crew be bad the whole theater slept while watch the movie some people run away in the middle amithab bachans act be poor i think this movie will be great hit of the year but this film will be the great flop of the yearsure nobody do justice to their work include ajay devagan this film dont deserve any audience i bet that this film will flop finally this movie suck  n  lorna green janine reynaud be a performance artist for wealthy intellectual at a local club she fall prey to her fantasy a the promise of romantic interlude turn into murder a she kill those who believe that sex be on the horizon it quite possible that through a form of hypnotic suggestion someone   a possible task master pull her string like a puppet be guide lorna into kill those she come across in secluded place just when it appear that lovemaking be about to begin after the murder within her fantasy be commit lorna awakens bewilder often clueless a to if what she be privy to within her dreams ever take place in reality if someone ask me how to describe this particular work from franco id say it elegant difficult by now youve probably read other user comment befuddle by what this film be about since a large portion of it take place within the surreal atmosphere of a dream franco mention in an interview that he be heavily influence by godard early in his career as far a filmmaking style and so decide to abandon a clear narrative structure in favor of try to create a whole different type of view experience and a you read from the reaction of the user comment here  some like this decision others find the style labour dull and bewildering ill be the first to admit that the film be over my head but even franco himself when quiz by critic who watch succubus admit that he didnt even understand the film and he direct it some might say that succubus be merely a precursor to his more admired work venus in fur consider his masterwork by francofaithful because it also adopt the surreal dreamlike structure where the protagonist doesnt truly know whether he she be experience something real or imagine in a sense like the protagonist we be experience the same type of confusion  certainly succubus be unconventional filmmaking where we arent give the key to what be exactly go on and a great deal of the elusive dialogue doesnt help matter succubus be also populate by beatnik type and poetspeak cormans film a bucket of blood poke fun at my personal favorite scene tease at a possible lesbian interlude between lorna and a woman she meet at a posh party  quite a bizarre fantasy sequence where mannequin be use rather unusually great location and jazz score  i like this film myself although i can understand why it do receive a negative reaction love that one scene at the posh party with lorna a wee bit drunk writhing on the floor in a gorgeous even gown a others attend the shindig   equally waste rush her in an emace of kiss  n  this outing of knotts include one of his best sidekick ever frank welker welker make the film knotts and welker compete for the laugh and both receive plenty knotts work for a small no where town where the city be be run by some of the most ignorant official when thing go wrong the city father allow knotts to take the fall frank welkers character befriends knotts and together they stumble together to clear up the mess and knotts good name this film show the usual knotts scar to death character that make him famous for year on television and film this may have be knotts last good outing when you have an extra minute get a good old fashion laugh a great icon don knotts  n  emma be a horribly flaw film base on jane austen classic novel i have not read the book so i really didnt know that much about the plot and yet i still predict nearly the entire plot there be also many scene that frustrate me because of the bad writing or direct the film be though for some reason very entertaining and i love it of course there be all the scene i dislike but the majority be well act and funny gwyneth paltrow give one of her best performance a the heroine in emma the film also star toni collette who have okay but have be much well ewan mecgreger who have also be well but he be still very good here alan cumming who i have never really be impress with and be pretty much the same here and jeremy northam who performance be rather wooden at first look but actually fairly subtle even if that be not what it need there have be much good adaptation of jane austen book but this one be still very entertaining and worth watching  n  why do i hate this let me list the way i have nothing against mary pickford but a year old woman play a year old be just stupid theres a fight scene in which kid be throw icks at each other and it consider funnyand it go on for minute strange how none of the kid be even remotely hurtthe title card contain plenty of racial and ethnic slursfor a family film the fight be way too violent love it when pickford be punch it out with a little boy and the humor be just stupid seriously minute in i give up and turn it off the slur racism and little kid throw icks at each other get to me also there be no plot that i could see the only thing worth see in this film be william haines who be a top lead man in the silent era just painful avoid  n  thank god this wasnt base on a true story because what a story it be populate by despicable character whose depravity know no bound before the devil be a mesmerize jawdropping excursion into perversion which would be laughable and sometimes be even with or perhaps because of the sickeningly tragic undercurrent of human dysfunction throughout if it werent carry out with such magnificent overwhelm conviction by it star the excellent script by kelly masterson and superb direction by none other than sidney lumet doesnt hurt either the main dysfunction here be of a family nature with the two majorly screw up others illiant portrayal from philip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke decide to rob their own parent jewelry store an attempt that go pathetically awry the story be tell with timeshifts which be note on screen such a charlie two day before the robbery so no one should be confuse some people have say they didnt like this device but i think it work perfectly add to the skeweredness of the whole affair consider that the two others in question be hardly play with full deck between them you couldnt make a decent poker hand to save your life throw in these cheesy extra tidbits one of the others be a drug addict marry to gina marisa tomei also excellent who be have an affair with the other other toss in some monumental sibling rivalry along with the fact that say drug addict other hat his father a wrenching performance from albert finney who have apparently cause him serious past pain and youve get a shakespearean greek tragedy on your hand proceed with caution  n  if you want just about everything you want to know about wwii from multiple perspective this dvd deliver you will learn new thing guarantee so much so that you wont need any other documentary on the subject get this watch it learn from it good for school use as well a a bonus watch this with tora tora tora save private ryan patton band of others

right there with them a they cross the big sky country and then into mexico and back to america again near the end of the movie the reflection of the rain on robert blake look like small river of sweat and tear roll down his face in the end we follow them up the stairway to their final moment the two criminal perform by robert blake and scott wilson a perry smith and dick hickock could be see on any street in any town hickock be a smile boy next door and smith the guy with star in his eye from the wrong side of town this point be make in the movie and it always surprise u that criminal be no different in appearance than anyone else evil even the most vile be part of the human condition these two delusional men kill an entire family look for a safe that isnt there once on the run they start write bad cheque carve out a trail for the authorities there be many fine support actor i like john forsyth a the detective on the case alvin dewey also will geer shine in a ief but excellent scene a the prosecute attorney i have often want to see this movie all the way through have only catch it in short snatch i do finally get to it after buy the dvd the result be the fine classic crime movie i have ever seen dont miss this illiant movie to me this be what great filmmaking be all about  n  this be a great show with total freshness and innovation that usual chair couch for a woman host that mandatory band play monotonous tune the same old joke the same pattern copy from the day of nebuchadnezzer      probably the pattern of johnny carson copy by one and all latterman leno conan     daly this show do not seem to have any of these i fell in love with this show within the first minute and i be go to stick to it though it too early to say that this show seem to be devoid of any intellectual pretension most talk show try so hard to project and i hope that that be what would make this show different from all the rest i hope that this show will last long return back after month i still love this show and i love his selfdeprecating humor for example his affirmation that only pothead loner would be home to watch his show at saturday midnight and thus the joke be funny only to the stone guy which however do not involve the usual monkeying of conan obrien for example i know it a cardinal sin to be repel by obriens antic but i do really dislike his style and repetitiveness i again watch it the other night with tom arnold in it ferensens spoof of trading spouse and nanny in an early episode be hilarious idiot paparazzo be fun especially when a security guard caution them against take people picture and if i be not mistake they start take his picture shout gary coleman added on th april come back once again i be leave confuse by the neighbor and her dog i can not decide if it be a joke or a real thing either way it be funny a hell i do not expect spike feresten to read these page but maybe he do he be crazy than a bunch of monkey and so i would better write down my suggestion here for him i would like him to do a full minute show with crazy gideon the star of late night tv commercial i would like crazy gideon to have an interview in spike talk show sing a song and play guitar do a skit in the line of snl and also to answer question from the audience regard his potential mayorship of los angeles i know crazy gideon may not be aware of this but there be website detail why he would be the perfect candidate for the post of the mayor of la  god willing return back on th july someone write here that the people who praise spike talkshow must be ibed by spike i confess that spike really ibed me but i must also confess that rockefeller name me in his will and last night i have sex with cindy crowford  n  it all about get what you want when you want it and the message of bluebeard eighth wife be to be careful what you wish for until what you wish for wish for you most men have hear the story about what happen when your sexual frustration isnt relieve and a certain part of your anatomy turn blue misogynistic pirate aside cooper play a very wealthy man who be very accustomed to get what he want whenever he want it learn only too late that it wasnt what he expect and never learn his lesson until he run into the feisty claudette colbert through a twist in soul and in practice business deal he end up marring buying her with the intent of bed her but she will have none of it literally and frustrate him at every turn and corner and room and tourist attraction the film have definite french sensibility which mean it have strong doubleentendres and boudoir humor for the day and a sharp edge youre not accustom to and may not enjoy see in either cooper or colbert the whole reason i watch the film be because they be likable actor and the whole point of this movie be that theyre unlikable people or at least likable people who have develop unlikable trait to protect themselves they think from the world if you can accept it on it own term youll find satisfaction in this witty and sophisticated film     and satisfaction a we say be what it all about such a movie with such a cast only come around after all once in a     ummm     blue moon  n  now i have read some negative review for this show on this website and quite frankly im appal for anyone to even think that the soprano be not television then im afraid i dont know what the world have come to let me tell u something i start watch many t v show like lose prison break dexter deadwood and even invasion but all of those show lose their touch after the first season especially lose and prison break which i refuse to watch because the company take genius idea and butcher them by make more than one season then we have the soprano i can honestly say that this be the only television series that i have ever watch where i have be enthral in all of it season and more importantly all of it episode there be no department that this show doesnt excel in act nothing short of superb james gandolfini be one of my favourite actor and i feel that his acting be absolutely stunning in every episode after i hear that hbo want ray liotta to play tony i felt that it wouldve be the good choice however after watch the first few episode i know that hbo have do a great job in cast james a tony the raw emotion he display be superb then we have everyone else edie falco michael imperioli lorraine bracco dominic chianese whom i remember a johnny ola in the godfather part and my personal two favourite character tony sirico and steve van zandt paulie walnuts gualtieri and silvio dante all of these actor perform to the best quality and all give an excellent performance in each episode then we have the story never have i be so suck into a t v show before the story be nothing short of excellent each episode be direct superbly and the score of this show be just fantastic i feel that the soprano be one show that i can watch again and again and never get bore of it got everything from hilarious humour to utal violence but nonetheless it be and will always be the best thing to ever grace the television and i challenge anyone to find a real flaw in the show not just say it too violent or they feel that the character of tony be immoral i mean it be a mafia show at the end of the day i dont think that the character be go to be very honest or loyal to god i implore everyone to watch this show because believe me youll be hook from the very first episode i be and i have even get a few friend who have firstly refuse to watch the show hook on it trust me when i say that this show be a godsend compare to the crap that come on t v after youve watch the first season youll inevitably agree with me when i once again say that this show dominate television and no t v show current or future will ever upstage the marvel that be the soprano  n  id give this a negative rating if i could i go into this movie not expect much but i have an open mind the whole thing be stupid the snake be obviously fake and the first two thing they bite be a boob and a guys johnson oh how original if i be a year old boy i might laugh at that i have no idea how this movie become so popular seriouslythe bad thing ive ever see i wasnt entertain it wasnt funnyi wasnt even bore i wasnt anything it wasnt even so bad it be good it just bad ridiculous actually please do not waste your money on this movie dont even rent this movie no clue how it get such a high rating  n  most people be totally unaware that this movie exist fox which pay judge to make it have keep it in the can for quite awhile and then spend nothing to promote it i guess that make many people think it be one of the garbage movie be flush in late summer well i be here to tell you that this be a funny and rather frightening look at a future that be not that hard to believe basically judge put forward the notion that the stupid be outeeding the smart by a wide margin then these stupid be get more stupid by basically spend all of their time watch tv and have sex which produce more stupid people by a person of average intelligence today will appear to be a genius that talk all faggy seriously be this really that hard to believe oh sure this future be painfully funny and ridiculously stupid but still plausible luke wilson be great a the time travel army guy hopelessly try to get back to a more comfortable time where this story will gain it cult status be with the numerous funny oneliners like can we family style her and hey man im bat here this be a funny movie and a rather sharp social commentary on an american society that seem to be fatuated with self pleasure comfort and stupidity and i guarantee you that i will be buy this on dvd the first day it come out and watch it over and over  n  this be a great ridiculous horror movie that capture the essence of the mid to late s obsession with how evil metal music supposedly be i can remember be freak out by metal teen when i be a kid it doesnt help that i find a desecrated grave in my hometown graveyard when i be ten turn out this weird metal kid have dig up some old body and use their bone in some weird sacrifice to satan so maybe stuff like deter me from metal for awhile but i love it now a a year old i buy this dvd use for buck and i expect it to suck due to the lame cover but to my surprise it rule it be all about the extreme demonic power of metal and you get ta love a scene where a guitar shoots lazers and vaporize headbangers in the crowd this movie be awesome if you love s metal and bad movie this one for you  n  while not quite as good a a murder be announce which be not only delightful but almost surpass the book this be an excellent adaptation and you know what it be a huge improvement on the geraldine mcewan version now i dont take pride in bad mouth the geraldine mcewan adaptation two or three of them be surprisingly good but others start off well but ruin by either a poor script a confusing final solution or both the geraldine mcewan version suffer from a plod pace and both of the above problem and i would consider second worst of the itv adaptation worst be sittaford mystery which even on it own merit turn out dull and confuse this adaptation of the book nemesis be a huge improvement it not only respect the book despite a few liberty but it pretty much rectify the problem the itv version have despite the added character of lionel come across a rather irritate more to do with how he be write than how he be act and one or two moment of sluggish pacing this be solid a an adaptation of a decent book it be beautifully film with nice photography and period detail and the music a always be excellent the performance be wonderful this time around and make the most of an in general welldone script with joan hickson illiant as always a miss marple and solid turn from liz fraser helen cherry joanna hole and anna cropper margaret tyzack be outstanding though in a chilling and move performance a clothilde overall well worth watch good than the recent version in pretty much all department bethany cox  n  good lord what be they think here be your spoiler warn even though i dont think itll really matter you wont be see this piece of trash anyway a group of handpuppets go chase after a group of really stupid people who go on a really stupid hunt for them to try and kill them and the puppet complicate thing by let them live out their really stupid fantasy in other word the whole thing be really stupid you know it have to be bad when even mike and the bot cant save something and they didnt i know some of their line be funny like what to add to the sign hit and the hand comment but geez this be pretty dang sad all i can say be do not watch this piece o crud it be not worth your eye  n  i have hear and read so many good thing about weed that i be look forward to get hook on another great cable series like entourage soprano or mad men but that slowly erode away with each episode i watch from season one didnt make it past the first six episodes the writing be unoriginal contrived and the portrayal of black embarrass the dialog felt force like the writer be try way too hard to be clever and hip it be a rare moment when i actually emit an audible laugh the character never develop enough for me to care about them they be selfish and unappealing i absolutely hat the addition of the brotherinlaw who should have be haul away on to catch a predator and the removal of the hodes daughter quinn from the cast by send her to board school in mexico be so unoriginal and clich   i have to conclude the writer be test the viewer loyalty episode after episode i like the character less and couldnt get past many of the technical flaw in the story line add to that i hear that season two wasnt a good so i lose all motivation to continue to watch this play out if youre a fan of good casting and write i suspect this show will be a challenge for you to like unless of course youre stone and then all bet be off  n  this movie be among my favorite foreign film some of the others be amilee and my life a a dog the similarity with those movie a with so many great foreign film be that it take a mundane slice of life and transform it into a profound heartfelt lesson in japan a man who be bore with his mundane life and the rut of his married life see a beautiful japanese woman star out the window of a dance studio in the instant that it take his train to pass he be enthral by her but be it only by her beauty by her faraway glance or a connection that they will both discover that they share shall we dance have memorable wonderful character who have to deal with painful reality by transcend them through the world of dance break traditional mould and stereo type of japanese society they risk all for happiness and find that joy be not too far away it be one of those movie that be so magical and meaningful and in itself transcend the mundane by show the true magic and miracle that life can be  n  a if the film be not of value in itself this be an excellent way to get an overview of the novel a a preface to read it in the summer of i saw the film in nyc that fall in graduate school i read the book for the first time some of the pleasure in read the novel be my memory of the scrupulously detailed film and for good or worseand ive now read and teach the novel for over three decadesmilo oshea be still leopold bloom  n  this film be a lyrical and romantic memoir tell through the eye an eleven year old boy living in a rural cuban town the year of the castro revolution it be an obviously genuine worthy labor of love the name cuba libre and cuban blood be merely attempt to wrongly market this a an action film dreaming of julia make much more sense it have more in common with european cinema than with rambo and the revolution be merely an inconvenience to people daily life and pursuit that fact alone make the film more honest than most work deal with this time period in cuban history the excessive use of the voiceover narrator do undermine the story but the film make up for it with unqualified clip from hollywood film that say so much more visually than the narrator could the comparison to cinema paradiso and be fair game a the film do wax melancholy about movie but there be an underlying pain at the loss of a lifestyle that surpass lose love the revolution like the film julie never seem to have an end  n  i saw zp when it be first release and find it a major disappointment it script seem forced and arch and too fakey s  it politics too upfront and ridiculous and let face it i be still under a lovespell know a blowup and i still havent completely shake it now the love be twist up with all sort of nostalgia it evoke and oh well good luck to me but time march on and time have be kind to zp and time have be a teacher to me i revisit this film about every ten year and it just get well and well with age and zp be it own experienceand be only really link to blowup through it creator the lategreat mr  antonioni twelve year ago i have the great good fortune to see an absolutely pristine print project at it correct size immense restore by an italian government cultural agency who know a good work of art when they see it and know the importance of keep such a thing of beauty in good shape to this day i remember the gasp from the audience when the first shot of death valley appear it be like a thousand volt visual shock antonioni have intentionally deliver to wake u up to a new level of awareness and indeed what follow from that point be an entirely different sort of place what be astonish to me be how this film be come into it own i remember the second time around see it the early s i have begin to feel affection towards the film a a whole and towards daria and mark in particular whereas before these two seem like a smartalecky shadow version of zefferellis olivia and leonard read romeo and juliet they now be engage me particularly the girl in her insistent slomotionality shetookhertime to live everything everything die around her upon excite the theater the daylight of reality quickly begin to erase my new find enjoyment the encroaching shoulderpadded big haired s whisper but thats a hippie fantasy let it gothe force of antonionis vision have i have realise already work itself inside of me the first time around so i answer s with an uhhuh and guard my love secretly possessively and jealously but this then be what good art do it live inside of you and if you wish it have it way and love you back secretly jealously and possessively and you get changed was thrill to see that turner classic movie have decide to show zp in it march lineup undoubtedly zp must be see on a gigantic screen so that it can truly take you into it constructed environment but hey sometimes even a glimpse of the beloved in a newspaper photo be no good than no glimpse at all today reality hit zp have be withdraw mysteriously and replace with the whiney antic of alices restaurant so it be still too difficult too disturb too what maybe it that a with all good art it live while everything dy around it peace  n  very strange but occasionally elegant exploitation movie with no real story but benefit from it stunningly ravish lead actress and a handful of nice gruesome makeup effect daniella be a beautiful twentysomething girl carry with her the trauma of be rap at the age of nightmare and hallucination lead her further into believe shes the reincarnation of a female ancestor who be say to be a werewolf she kill her otherinlaw during a nightly encounter and get submit in a hospital she escape again however and randomly devours more men whilst on the run for police detective doctor and relatives it all pretty to look at and listen too really great soundtrack but the absence of plot and continuity become irritate quite fast luckily enough leading lady annik borel rarely ever wear clothes and she fill up the boring moment by dance naked around a fire the film be too long too weird and too forgettable the big surprise come at the end when

and billie baby blue marine and white line fever in the mids be amazingly good jmv performance he be both an action star and a heartthrob all at the same time he make a lot of quality movie during his

country he must have perform some of the stunt work as well there be a harrow river scene at the end of the movieand it look like he the guy get toss down the river to me but really at the height of his popularity this movie could have do so much more with jmvs talent and his look innocence can only be so interesting evil a explore in buster and billie be much more dramatic anyway glynnis oconnor be delightful a rise the whole look of the movie be like a norman rockwell paint the outdoor scene be gorgeous must have be film in canada  n  johnny and june carter cash finance this film which be a traditional rendering of the gospel stories the music be great you get a real feel of what the world of jesus look like ive be there too and june get into the part of mary magdalene with a passion cash narration be good too but        the actor who play jesus be miscast there be no edge to the story like cash put in some of his faith base music because it be uncompelling i doubt well see this ever widely distribute again id love to buy the cd tom paine texas usa  n  j  niksen vuosi be one of jarvas most political movie it take stance strongly against modern day societys authority status in the life of the common man and how it have estrange men from the nature completely it challenge the whole concept of freedom and wealth in our welfare society vatanen antti litja smother buy the concrete jungle with all it rule and regulation try to rattle the chain of the society by escape it all in to the wilderness of northern finland only to realize that the concept of a free country isnt all that unambiguous in other word the society have the common man by the balls still the thing that make j  niksen vuosi so exceptional besides the visual and humouristic illiance be how it seem to illustrate the whole political atmosphere in finland in the s as well a the whole identity of finland a a nation vatanen be like an archetype of a classical finn in his solitudeness and social distantness since nature have always play such an important role in the national identity of u finns the whole idea of that be slowly take away by the modern society make j  niksen vuosi emotionally exceptionally move  n  i love jamie foxx and i enjoy of all movie i see and i walk out of this one now i admit it may have have something to do with the two middleaged white woman in the back of theatre who laugh at every little thing oh no jamies knock on a door hee hee hee but     this be just so incredibly annoy there could be no sustained camera shot and no camera shot from a conventional angle     everything have to be inyourface loud and annoying the bad guy try to be smooth and malkovichlike but at this point it just old and tire he ought nothing new or interesting from all the character too many line you saw come too many youve hear before and too many tough guy line     and i dont mind that sort of thing really as long a there a bit of originality to it in fact pretty much the entire supporting cast just sucked i love jamie foxx and i think he really funny and i think he be funny in this movie     but not nearly funny enough for me to endure everything else this movie need less shootemup less annoy camera shot more emotion more feeling and more jamie foxx i give it a  n  after see dick tracy in the bin at future shop i decide to give it a go with no previous knowledge and be a big fan of mafia and crime movie i be very surprised to see a very fun smart entertain movie with solid performance throughout the movie move along well it have of course another solid performance from warren beatty but the real standouts of the film be al pacino and madonna i be happy to find out that pacino be nominate for his performance a an over the top gangster try to take down the city madonna be great a the damsel in distress she really impress me and add depth to her performance if you go in with the attitude of want to watch a fun smart movie with great act and a solid script then give dick tracy a try i dont think you will be disappointed and watch for the cameo from paul sorvino james caan kathy bates and dustin hoffman among others  n  send them to the freezer this be the solution two butcher find after they discover the popularity of sell human flesh an incredible story with humor and possible allegory that make it much more than a horror film the complex character defy superficial classification and make the story intriguing and worthwhile if you can stand it definitely a dark film but also a bit redemptive  n  wow i pick this off the rental shelf because i love robert carlyle and jonny lee miller in trainspotting this be a phenomenal movie it have action romance suspense intrigue and wit when i wasnt laugh i be at the edge of my seat this be definitely a film i would recommend to people with an appreciation for intelligent dialogue and a fresh perspective of the th century this film have everything to keep me happy  n  i dont know why some people criticise that show so much it be a great funny show probably not the right material for mainstream primetime but still     the family dynamic be funny and all in all the same you see in most comedy show the support character be absolutely hilarious the plot of the individual episode and the frequent siegfried roy jibe be only just above average but ever so often you have subplots or oneliners that make you roll on the floor laughing this show be well worth the pound i pay for it rating  n  mexican werewolf in texas be set in the small border town of furlough where anna erika fay live her best friend be rosie martine hughes she have a mexican boyfriend name miguel gaiel gutierrez who be determine to track a beast down that have be terrorise the town kill livestock several resident include some of their friend local mexican legends speak of the chupacaa an evil creature from myth legend erm im struggle now because not that much else actually happen     write direct by scott maginnis i wont beat about the bush here simply say that mexican werewolf in texas be awful period the script only ever mention the word werewolf once the rest of the time it refer to a chupacaa in fact i suspect this wasnt really conceive a a werewolf flick at all the werewolf creature look mostly hairless more like some vicious dog there be no reference to anybody change during the full moon it actually attack during the day on a couple of occasion there be no transformation scene at the end when it be kill it doesnt change back into anyone either to be honest apart from the title theres nothing here to indicate a werewolf film at all even then the title be just a ripoff of the highly popular an american werewolf in london this be the type of home make crap that i personally think be kill the horror genre how long have it be since there be a true low budget horror classic like dawn of the dead the evil dead halloween or friday the th which be all make on shoe string budget maybe the blair witch project but thats it in recent year crap like mexican werewolf in texas have absolutely no chance of ever be consider a classic the character be awful thing just happen around them the dialogue be rubbish the pacing be terrible the story suck virtually send me to sleep a a whole this film be just crap im sorry but i dont know how else to describe it director maginnis do nothing to make this watchable theres the annoy hand hold camera type cinematography which could easily give someone a headache quick blink youll miss something edit which just annoy irritates in equal measure it not scary there no nudity theres no tension or atmosphere the special effect be awful the monster really do look poor it no wonder maginnis keep it in the shadow or cut his scene so quickly you never get a good look at it theres virtually no colour to the picture either it either almost pitch black or over saturated desert sand orange which make the thing an eye sore as well the gore consist of some fake gut blink youll miss them a few bloody wound a severed arm big deal with a supposed budget of about i admit the budget be low but i simply refuse to accept that for make such a rubbish film there be plenty of low budget horror flick that make their meagre budget go far the whole thing have the look of a home movie it have no style be throughly bland dull to look at the act suck too although you probably already know that mexican werewolf in texas will probably con a few people into renting buying watching it because they might mistakenly think it a sequel to john landis classic which it most certainly isnt it isnt even a proper werewolf flick either dont be fool this be awful im feed up of have to waste time money on home make amateur crap like this  n  i find this to be a surprisingly lighthanded touch at a s cultureclash movie john wayne would hardly be one first choice a a cultural attache be about a diplomatic with his good intention a a bullrun in harrod but this time he be leave to play a part that be far more passive than his usual bluff persona and he accomplish his task with style the duke be a guy who really could act well his facial expression and body language could be extremely subtle despite his considerable presence both a an actor and in term of screen time he fail to dominate this movie many of his good intention come a cropper he have authority over nobody and the intermittent narrative be provide by the titular geisha to whom he be the barbarian the story of american attempt to curry favour with an isolationist japan be one of political intrigue rather than swashbuckling or hellforleather battle i can not comment on the accuracy of it research but the strangeness of the oriental culture to western sensibility be demonstrate well there be a great deal of minutelychoreographed ceremony entail what look to this observer like authentic costume and prop the set piece be complex and detail a lot of money and thought have be apply to it the fractured romance between wayne and his geisha add a little extra element and stop the movie become just a political or flagwaving effort script be good without be too wordy there be a great deal of japanese dialogue but the lengthy period of translation didnt interfere with the narrative it be nice to see plenty of genuine oriental on the set whether or not they be japanese i couldnt say but anyway they look the part at least the lead be not play by crossdressing caucasian unlike other effort such a blood alley yes i know they be chinese the inn of the sixth happiness or even the king and i frankly i enjoy this more than any of those other movie the script be good for a start i never like the song in the king and i and wasnt impress by the heavyladen anticommunist subtext of blood alley i confess to never have see this work before and find it compare very favourably to many of the duke more popular outings recommended  n  i be so glad i come across this short film im always so disappointed that short film be hard to come across so when i saw this and saw that it be nominate for the live action short film at the academy award i be so pleased that i actually have a film that i be root for the plot be pretty simple the director writer and star nacho vigalondo try come up with a reason people would suddenly eak out into a song and dance number like they do in movie musical the result be extremely entertaining and the song be actually really catchy its a well make short film well edit and the actor all do a great job and the last shot of the film be perfect i highly recommend this film  n  i think before start with these movie that it might be a good one but when i start with it i find it really awful they say movie be be make in afghanistan but i think of the movie be shoot in india you can see indian make car you can see lars drink bisleri an indian water and hindi write on the road you can also see temple in afghanistan  hahah  it really funny and many more stuff which prove it not shoot in afghanistan i think one should not waste his her time watch this movie   pure time waste   i would recommend to do something else instead of watch this movie or may be might heart be well idea but dont watch this waste of time  n  truly appalling waste of space me and my friend try to watch this film to it conclusion but have to switch it off about minute from the end and i can count the film i have switch off before the end on one hand the script and direction be leaden and deeply uninspiring i wouldnt be surprise if they find the script in a pile of cast off script from for example the irritating scroat threaten the real estate guy from his house phone i mean seriously the police would be beat his door down in minute the scene and event just wash by you like turd in a river it be difficult to understand the actual thrust of the film the narrative flick between character in a seemingly random manner eaking up the pathetic attempt at build the character oh and what character they be the protagonist play by rourke be dreadful he could have just send a cardboard cut out of himself and stay in bed after or so minute of the film i have build absolutely zero attachment to this character he be neither sympathetic nor hateful just a disfigured dummy from a shop window blunder through every single scene his motivation be impossible to discern from his generally mumble and emotionless delivery be he happy be he sad angry no idea just those same dead eye star out at you from a disfigured chunk of flesh and the native american theme be just awful and pointless the good guy be at best unlikeable a dull white collar stereotype and a simpering neurotic exwife stereotype cue archetypal wife with shotgun face off with bad guy you arent go to shoot me that be both tiresomely unoriginal and annoying the richie nix character seem interest at first but soon descend into an irritate one side psycho character which seem at odds with the seem intention of make the bad guy in some way sympathetic or at least realistically motivated roasario dawson character start with some promise but soon descend into a sickening and childlike parody of the gangster chick scene from jackie brown you really want me to believe her character be so attracted to rourkes or bad she be just a floozy who sleep with anything that move realistic female character ftw in summary a complete mess of a film hopeless characterisation and performances a leaden and hackneyed script along with uninspired direction and ultimately extremely dull it not even comedy bad either laugh at rourkes haggard face get pretty old after sit through the first turgid minute of the film  n  in this movie ch  vez supporter either venezuelan and notvenezuelan just lie about a dramatic situation in our country they do not say that the conflict start because of ch  vez announcement fire a lot of pdvsa best worker just for political issues they do not say anything about more than tv interruption transmit by ch  vez during only day in cadena nacional a kind of confiscation o private tv signal each one with about minute of duration they do not tell u anything about the quiting announcement make by general en jefe lucas rincon romero inspector general of the army force who be a traditional supporter of ch  vez even now in despite of his announcement he be the ministro de interior y justicia after ch  vez return he occuped the charge of ministro del defensa equal to defense secretary in u  they do not say anything about ch  vez order about shoot against a pacifical people concentration who be claim for elections they do not say anything about the people in this concentration that be kill by ch  vez supporter either civilian and military official force  they present some fact in a wrong order in order to lie they do not say anything about venezuelan civilian society thats be even now claim for an election in order to solve the crisis and ch  vez action in order to avoid the elections thats why i tell you     this movie be just a lot of lie or a big lie  n  one could wish that an idea as good a the invisible man would work good and be more carefully handle in the age of fantastic special effect but this be not the case the story the character and finally the entire last minute of the film be about as fresh a a madscientist flick from the early s  there be some great moment mostly due to the amazing special effect and to the very idea of an invisible man stalk the street but ala soon be back in the cramped confinement of the underground lab which mean that the rest of the film be not only predictable but schematic there have be a great many remake of old film or tv show over the past year and some of them have their charm but it become clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of put ol classic under the nose of eager madman like verhoeven who do have his moment be a very bad one it be obvious that the money be the key issue here the time and energy put into the script be nowhere near enough and a a result hollow man be seriously undermine with clich  s sappy character predictability and lack of any depth whatsoever however the one thing that actually impress me beside the special effect be the swearing when make this kind of film modern producer be very keen on allow kid to see them therefore the language and sometimes the violence and sex be very toned down when the whole world blow up the good guy go oh darn and oh my god hollow man gratefully discard that kind of hypocrisy and the character be at liberty to say what come most natural to them im not say that the most natural response to something go wrong be to swear but it make it more believable if someone actually swear i think we can thank verhoeven for that  n  ok so it owe pulp fiction but in my opinion have it own voice and identity mainly because of the musicvideo direction style sketchlike narrative and great performance thomas jane delivers great the drugdealer showdown be extraordinary aaron eckhart likewise james legros have a short and effervescent appearancegreat humorthey get the wong house the porzikova interrogation and rape scene be memorable a be mickey rourkes cameo appearancetake a peak great hollywood popcorn bproduction with strong performance of alevel aspirant and renegade rourke  well take a peak it worth  n  as far a i know the real guy that the main actor be play saw his performance and say it be an outstanding portrayal id agree with him this be a fantastic film about a quite gifted boy man with a special body part help him oscar and bafta winning and golden globe nominate daniel daylewis play christy browna cripple man with cereal palsy who spend most of his life on the floor in a wheelchair and carry by his family he have a special left foot though he can write with it paint with it and hold thing with it he learn to speak later in the film it be very good for a guy like him also star home alone s oscar winning and golden globe nominate brenda fricker a mrs  brown and bafta win ray mcanally a mr  brown it be nominate the oscar for best director for jim sheridan best write screenplay base on material from another medium and best picture it be nominate the baftas for best film best make up artist and best adapt screenplay daniel daylewis be number on the great movie star he be number on the great british actor he be number on britain fine actor and he be number on the world great actor and the film be number on the great british film outstanding  n  all i ever heard while be raise be equality of the sex and here we have a film that not only exemplify imbalance but continue through with a whole concept that one sex be well all the while watch i be hop for that redeem quality to make the viewer feel a though there be hope for the future and there wasnt ill admit to not finish the film i have to turn it off at the part where the old man whore tell the genetic man adam that it be ok to be a whore and get and i quote more tail than any man in the past time i know not finish it be a bad review on myself but it be the responsibility of the writer and crew to develope a story that will keep a viewer interested and they fail this film betray all true female nature quality of the mother figure and the need for balance instead it exemplify what america ran by lesbian natzis would be likeand im not against lesbian thank you mr  director someone please give me a redeeming quality     wait i have it theres no sequel  n  i do regret that i have buy this series i expect more action more objective picture and more consistency this be just a pure propaganda series very dark without any charm or romanticism it be just boredom itself i find the actor work quite weak a well odonnell might seem charm a robin with batman but in this picture he lack any charm probably while he become old he be loose his childish charm but do not gain any charm of a grow up it come a no surprise that it be not show in a lot of country and be be sell in the uk for of the recommended price and be not even release in the netherlands  n  the story have be tell before a deadly disease be spread around     but the extra in this film be peter weller his interpretation of muller on the run be real he be indeed a desperate person just go home to see his child this person could be work next to you  n  this film be very well advertised i be an avid movie goer and have see preview for this movie for month while i be somewhat skeptical of how funny this movie would actually be my friend think it be go to be great and hype me up about it then i go and saw it i be sink down in my seat almost asleep until i remember that i have pay for this movie i make myself laugh at most of the stuff in the movie just so i wouldnt feel bad and destroy the good mood i be in plus i want to get my monies worth out of the movie i always go into a movie with an open mind not try to go into them with too many expectation but this movie be not that funny now it wasnt the bad movie ive ever see but it be definitely worth wait for hbo if you havent see many preview for the movie or you like very slow and corny comedy you may enjoy it but for true comedy fan id say pas maybe even check out the king of comedy again something tell me to go see meet the parent instead  n  as far a i know this be my first experience with icelandic movie it such a relief to see something else than your regular hollywood motion picture too bad that movie like this one have a small chance of succeed in the big world i can only hope that people watch this by accident by recommendation or other     because it really worth while i leave the cinema feel really sad i couldnt get the tragic destiny of the character out of my head and it impress me even more when i thought of the complexity of the film not only be it a tragic story it have excellent comic relief and a very good soundtrack if you have the opportunity watch it it really think provoking and make me ponder a lot  n  very typical almod  var of the time and in it own way no less funny than many of his later work and why be that there be nothing to be provoke or shock about and i guess any such effect be more coincidental than intentional no the great humor stem from an underlie almost surreal absurdity that be weave into the scenery the character nearly complete lack of taboo it the same kind of comic suspense you find in his later work though youll find it in a more rough version here hes build up for masterpiece to come but be not yet there the sole reviewer who comment on this movie before i do claim that it have to be a very select group of people whod find this movie hilarious i do  n  once again doctor who deliver the good by the bucket load it have humour youre just make it up a you go along yup but i do it illiantly action monster in this case still more kickass cybermen tragedy and scare tactic in short just what the doctor order pun intend the way that the emotion move from one to the other be do so well that there be no feeling of get on with it so chalk up out of the last episode that have make you laugh then make you cry and make you go eek in term of character development this be clearly the clincher for noel clarkes mickey and ricky be one of the doctor companion you know that he will do the right thing and may even suspect the manner that he do it however it be still an emotional wrench when he confirm his future path while the rise of the cybermen have more of the sinister build up to terror the age of steel be an all out blast like alien compare to alien both true classic but in different way can the series keep it up at this level let hope so  n  a brother promise be a wonderful family film this be a biography of dan jansen a champion olympic speed skater the movie depict this athletes life from a young age through full adulthood the love and support of the family member be evident throughout how dan and the rest of his family handle winning and losing race be a life lesson for all of u the commitment and determination of dans coach and his teammate show what it take to make a real team how dan and his family deal with a devastate illness of a loved one be depict without undo sentiment or sugarcoat the faith of the family be show in basic term and be obviously a major part of their life this be a powerful family film which can be meaningful for a person of any age  n  well     now that i know where rob zombie steal the title for his house of corps crapfest i can now rest in peace nothing about the somnambulant performance or trite script would raise the dead in the house of seven corps but a groovie ghoulie come up from his plot ha anyway to kill the bloody amateurs make a lowrent horror flick in his former abode in hell house sorry i dont remember the actual name of the residence a bunch of mysterious unexplained death take place long ago some like arthritic lurch standin john carradine whose small role provide the film only worthwhile moment attribute it to the supernatural bellowing film director john ireland dismiss it a superstitious hokum the result come across like satan school for girl catchy title madefortv production value intrigue plot cross with child shouldnt play with dead thing lowrent movie about lowrent movie maker who wake the dead trouble be it nowhere near a entertaining or fun the house of seven corps be dead at frame one and spend the rest of it minute go through rigor mortis drag u along for every ache second      n  director sidney lumet have make some masterpieceslike networkdog day afternoon or serpico buthe be not have too much luck on his most recent works gloria be pathetic and find me guilty be an interestingbut fail experiment nowlumet ings his best film in decade andby my point of viewa true masterpiece before the devil know youre dead i think this film be like a rebirth for lumet this movie have an excellent story whichdeeplyhas many layers alsoi think the end of the movie be perfect the performance be illiant philip seymour hoffman ingsas usuala magnificent performance and hesno doubtone of the best actor of our days ethan hawke be also an excellent actor but he underrate by my point of view his performance in here be great the rest of the cast be also excellent speciallythe great albert finney but these two actor ing monumental performance which be sadly ignore by the pathetic oscars the film have a good level of intensityin part thanks to the performance andin partthanks to the illiant screenplay before the devil know youre dead be a real masterpiece with perfect directiona great screenplay and excellent performances we need more movie like this  n  i take my year old to see this movie we leave after or minute it be absolutely awful this movie should be rat r at the least i be not that strict with movie but this be just too much it be a waste of money i think it would contain some comedy and i know the comedy would probably be crude but this be way beyond crude i be sit there watch and read a certain subtitle at the beginning of the movie be what really get me and i could not believe how crudely sexual it be i could not believe that it would be ok for a year old to read and see this content i dont understand how the rating system works       i love this film i think it would be easy to watch and easy to forget i run out after watch this to buy the dvd obv not easily forget the script be illiant and the casting couldnt be more perfect each character have their moment and i laugh hard throughout this film comedic timing be spoton  n  it not easy to find judas kiss on vhs it not available on dvd but i want to add this rather obscure movie to my alan rickman movie collection i cant understand how the talented mr  rickman get into these mediocre film judas kiss boast several wonderful actor an interesting plot and intriguing twist but it strange visual wandering and chop edit ruin what might have be a great crime drama many scene seem to be miss vital information to explain the character action why be our hero immediately suspicious of his boss why do he mistrust the detective he replace there be time when i honestly couldnt tell if the director mean judas kiss to be a legitimate crime drama or a campy spoof why else would he toss in a topless alien lesbian porno scene in the first two minute that little surprise certainly make me scramble for the remote since my kid be play nearby do he purposely instruct his two distinguish english actor alan rickman and emma thompson to use such awful new orleans accent a an alan freak i confess that i still think mr  rickman be sexy in a rumpled weary takehimhomeandtuckhimin sort of way judas kiss isnt a great movie but it do have some intriguing moment but i dont recommend it unless youre try to immerse yourself in alan rickman  n  first of all i should point out that i really enjoy watch this documentary not only it have great music in it but the shot and the editing be also wonderful however all these positive thing about the film do not change the fact that it play to the orientalist east meet west clich   that bother many turk like myself okay this film tell the story of traditional and contemporary turkish music in a very stylish manner which be a good thing something that would show ignorant european and americans that this country be not just about murder armenian and kurd however the problematic of the film be that it look at what it define a east from the eye of the west i mean like one jazz musician say in the film maybe there be no east and west maybe it be just a myth a lie create by the rule leader of western country in order to keep fear and hostility alive so that they could continue rule the world and keep the cash flow why dont you think about that  n  stmd be not a terrible movie but it be quite forgettable the lighting be intentionally poor in many scene and unintentionally poor in all the rest so you be likely to come out of a viewing with a headache or eyestrain special effect be imaginative but obvious the gratuitous nudity essential for teen slasher flick be there of course along with the archetypical teenager but the whole movie just doesnt gel what be need be some snappy dialogue and more tongueincheek humor i cant really recommend that you use your time watch this movie i often give a nod to a movie base on just a scene or two that demonstrate imagination or humor but these be sadly lack in this film  n  first off i have no idea how this movie make it to the big screen it not even the low budget scifi channel movie it just awful me and my friend who love action movie independence day jurassic park lotr etc go to see this movie expect this movie to me a transformer with dragon mindless entertainment all we get be a mindless hour and a half the cg be not as bad a i be expect but the plot be so awful along with the act it make up for it it basically a chinese legged of dragon return every year     sound like a good remake of rain of fire no the plot try to be deep than it should be leave not only plot hole but with magic and a very small actual war between dragon rather big snake it just get ridiculous the director attempt to add a bit of humor in the movie which fail me and my friend laugh through the whole thing along with all of the audience and cant believe we spend money on this the short trailer on tv make up for most of the action while crap make up the rest ive see a lot of b movie like reptilian the cave spider and others but i have to say if you want a non stop laugh for an hour watch this story cg act  i dont drink     but it would have help before watch this movie  n  i be not exactly how sure the accuracy be with this movie but i can tell you that i be thoroughly entertain by this movie the character of gustplayed perfectly by phillip seymour hoffman be one of the most unique yet entertain character in recent memory this movie informedyet manage to avoid preach to the audience it make me laugh make me sad make me feel alive and glad to be spend the time to watch the movie it take no time to understand what be go on and take you on a roller coaster ride of genuine human emotion i think i knew my history apparently i didnt know it at all i give this move out of and recommend it for all adult and young adult and the young at heart just not the young but as soon a they be allow to see r rat movie make it a priority  n  i must have see this a dozen time over the year i be about fifteen when i first saw it in b w on the local pb station i buy a dvd set for the child to see and be make them watch it they dont teach history in school and this explain the most critical event of the th century it expand their critical thinking impartially with the participant on all side explain in their own word what they do and why it detail what lead up to the war and the actual war buy it for your child along with alistair cooke america watch it with them and make them understand youll be so glad you do  n  steven seagals film of late have not exactly be good but this be by far the bad since the patriot the plot make no sense what so ever it be never clear in what the relationship between the character be who work for who or who be double cross who the film be completely disjointed each scene seem to confuse the story far rather than carry it forward even the action sequence be uninspired and hard to follow most of the blame must lie at the director foot for not even understand the basic of film making but seagal do not get off lightly a one of the producer of this film he must also share the blame oh and i havent even mention how awful the acting be even by seagal standard even a straight to video fodder this be not worth a view even for seagal fan give it a wide berth  n  and i for one think that be a good thing ive just never be a rosalind russell fan although the original be my favorite rr movie but i love bette and be thrill to hear she be make this as for the rest of the production i think it be slightly less than the original movie one of my favorite minor character in the original be mazeppa with her scratchy fingernailsontheblackboard voice belt out hey it take a lot more than no talent to be a strippah and although i miss it i be glad to see the producer have the gut not to do a carbon copy i also like the fact there be large portion of this movie which be film a if you be look at a stage it give a feeling that you be in the theatre not just at the movies i think the other thing i like about this production be that there seem to be slightly less repetition of the song let me entertain you which become completely annoying after about the th time you hear it  n  so real and surreal all in one i remember feel like tessa heck i remember be tessa this be a beautiful vignette of a relationship end i especially like the protester tangent it be nice to see symbolism in a movie without be smack over the head with it if you get the chance to see this take it it be well worth the minute  n  thank god i watch this at a friends place and do not pay for it the plot be horribly transparent and the whole movie felt like an episode of a tv show if you have any knowledge of computer or electronics watch out you will feel feel like the movie be an insult to your intelligence also actress turn much music vj amanda walsh display the bad act i have ever see exclude porn shes lucky that matt lanter be actually decent hes the one that carry the movie i hate that i waste nearly two hour of my life watch this movie it a shame that they get to call it a sequel because i be a fan of the original which be actually pretty good  n  a friend lent me this dvd which he get from the director at a festival i think i go in warn that some of the technical aspect of the movie be a bit shaky and that the writing be good but not great so maybe that color my judgment but i have to admit that i like this movie the standouts where the actor youssef kerkor be really good a ernie the main character kind of pathetic in a likable way adam jones who also direct and justin lane be excellent a the roommate who drive ernie mad the bill character justin lane who spend a lot of the film dress like a panda be by far my favorite he seem the least onedimensional and remind me of an old college roommate so much i call the guy after watch the dvd really kind of lovable and very funny some of the other acting be good some be soso but none of it be bad i also really like the vigilante duo ridiculous and funny im give this one high mark even though it have some issue because you can tell when you watch it that these people care and decide to make their movie their way well do to adam jones and crew  n  shawshank godfather pulp fiction     all good film great film but nothing and i mean nothing live up to the great christmas movie of all santa claus the film be so great and have so many message i cry while watch it seriously this be one of those movie you need to watch time when we see pitch get tell he will have to eat ice cream we see the sadness in his eye and we feel the deep sorrow and then we wonder     what be so bad about this ice cream be it imply that we a human be treat ice cream a good when all it do be make u evil think movie make you think this movie have the best rendition of santa claus ever unlike other santa he be a normal person we see him imprison child and spy on kid dream and we wonder be the santa we believe in really that good also this santa actually mention christ the whole meaning behind christmas you owe yourself to watch this cinematic masterpiece we should just stop make movie and air nothing but this epic whether it christmas or not this movie get a whoever say this movie be bad be an ignorant fool  n  i really cant think of anything good to say about this film     not a single thing the script be a nightmare   the writer blur the line between chemical and biological trait and doesnt seem to understand the difference youd think they would at least get a technical advisor the performance be bad by most of the cast     although i dont really blame them   the material really stink the editing be equally bad   ill just stop now   it all bad  n  cinema great period start in postwar europe with italys neorealist movement during the next or decade that follow france new waver catch everyones attention and there be always bergman up there on his desolate scandinavian island somewhere make bitter masterpiece but in luchino visconti ought the artform to full circle geographically speak with his miraculous work  death in venice  which might as well be call  the death of europoean cinema  after the sixty wind down so do the great european filmmaker who with some exception generally grow exhaust and pass the torch to a new american generation of movie brat coppola scorsese co  this movie absolutely feel like a grand summingup not just of visconti particular obsession but of the general attempt of european filmmaker to achieve the aesthetic ideal in movie and rest assure you will find no sterner taskmaster than the visconti reveal here hes not play to the crowd folk either you get behind him and follow along or you get leave behind the pacing be a challenge slow but never without emotional weight incident be few and far between but each seem load with symbolic significance in a sturmunddrang cosmos we will probably never be in such rarefied company again in term of the movie one of the century great writer who inspire the tale thomas mann one of the great filmmaker direct it visconti one of the great actor in the lead role dirk bogarde and swell almost ceaselessly in the background gustav mahler th symphony take full advantage of mahler ability to inspire romanticism in even the most cynical east visconti change the main character aschenbach into a decrepit composer from his original persona a a writer even make bogarde up to look like mahler geeky mustache spec shaggy hair ducklike walk bogarde by the way delivers what be probably great performance of an actor in the history of movie it a largely silent performance and the actor have to deliver ream of meaning in a gesture or a glance a difficult trick without mug like chaplin or merely act like an animated corpse cinema just doesnt get good than this ill ignore the complaint from the ritalinaddicts out there who say that it too slow but even the more legitimate gripe concern some of aschenbachs flashback with that antagonistic friend of his be misplace the flashback fit neatly within the movie thematic concern i e which be the good path to aesthetic perfection passion or discipline and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruption serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewer of course some viewer will sleep through this movie anyway a nonstop stream of mahler and beautiful dying venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture but this movie be actually about something and what it mostly about be suffer romantic capital r suffer in particular a a suffering romantic himself visconti knew whereof he speak spoiler i guess if for nothing else see  death in venice  for it portentous opening credit and for it unforgettable end with bogardes jetblack hairdye drip off of his sweaty die head and onto his chalkwhite face meanwhile off in the distance young tadzio the object of bogardes die desire stand in the ocean and point toward the horizon like a michelangelo sculpture the climatic sequence sum up with agonize economy everything that the movie be about love lust beauty loss the end of a life set against the beginning of another life and cold death in the midst of warm sunny beauty  death in venice  be a miraculous work of art dvd tip a with the simultaneously release visconti masterpiece  the damned  i recommend that you turn the english subtitle on while watch this movie it ostensibly in english but the dvd sound seem muddy and theres a lot of italian spoken during the film anyway  n  this be a stereotype plot a young fighter try to enter a competition when he be not ready and be not select to represent his fight school this lead to separation from the fight school and naturally he find a strange new master to teach him to fight the fight be not of high standard they be way too simple in a way that be simple to every adult the fighter have train and enter the ring but do not do what he train and get an as kick the coach yell do this and do that with no success and after some more of this ridiculous beating he suddenly do what he be told and hit his opponent once this result in a turning point in the fight although our hero have be take a beating of his life up until that point think about the rocky movie and youll have a good point of reference of how much beating he really take the fight be also shoot poorly there final thing that screw this film up be the stupid romance cheesy music and awkward moment be not what i call entertainment these guy really could have make some quality entertainment but the director wasnt up to the task or the other crew in my opinion maybe they have a small budget i dont know but what matter in the end be that this movie be bad and deserve the rating of out of  n  this production be quite a surprise for me i absolutely love obscure early s movie but i wasnt prepare for the last minute of this story if by any chance youre not convince in the first half hang in there for the finale of course you must look at the blatant racism a be purely topical a fascinating viewing experience but i think the cat paw be not available on video dvd yet watch your pb listing  n  it isnt too bad but ultimately it lack the quality that the australian series has the joke be few and far between the actor be attractive they shouldnt be the film maker think far too much about the cinematography it suppose to look like a home video and it just like a serious version of kath and kim     it stupid its too normal to be kath and kim kath and kim be suppose to be two curvy middleaged woman who think they be hot and wear ridiculous clothes there be no look at me kimmy joke the fat friend of kim be not fat at all and shes not even slightly stupid shes a stereotypical black latino chick its just not a stupid or funny a the australian series it doesnt compare nothing be the same i admit this show be pretty funny at time but it be not anything like the aussie series i be look forward to an american take on a bogan family they fail it suppose to be really stupid and hilarious but the actor dont act stupid to me this be just a typical american tv show it a let down if you want it to be anything like the aussie show star because it be an okay show just nothing like what it should be  n  from the decrepit rank of the already oversaturated hillybilly horror subgenre come this woeful tale of a vacation family terrorize by ined redneck sound familiar well it most definitely should to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the horror genre there be absolutely new here the film seem content to recycle all thee old wear out clich  s deform hick a peaceful family turn guntoting killer when push come to show the rebellious daughter the one freak who good at heart etcetera     but do even that halfheartedly enough to make this an utter waste of time this be forgettable dreck but humorously enough lead j d hart once star in a movie call film that suck early in his career quite an ironic omen indeed my grade d  n  a a huge baseball fan my scrutiny of this film be how realistic it appear dennis quaid have all of the right move and stance of a major league pitcher it be a fantastic true story tell with just a little too much disney for my taste  n  this film take you on one family impossible journey and make you feel every step of their odyssey beautifully act and photograph hearteakingly real it last line with it wistful hope be one of the more powerful in memory  n  stupid stupid stupid i can not stand ben stiller anymore how this man be allow to still make movie be beyond me i cant understand how this happen if i perform at work the way he act in a movie id get fire and i own the company       i would have to fire myself god this movie be just a plain steam stink pile of poo that need to be vapoorized if that be possible something else i have to say the guideline about line of text in a comment be idiotic what be wrong with just say a few thing about a movie i will never understand why site will require a short novel write when sometimes a ief comment be all that be necessary  n  this show be great for many reasons  the father and mother can communicate with their kid this day in age it so great to see a real family instead of some stuffy overact family i watch this one time and become hooked it so great to see a black family on tv worth watch this show leave too soon but on it way out it deal with pregnancy sexy drug bad datesdeath etc  the best thing about the show be that it deal with it in a real humorous sort of way great show for the family   i cant tell you how many time i have sit up watched this show late at night sometimes and laugh my head off great pg rat show i loved everybit of this show  n  this film be where the batman franchise ought to have stop though i will concede that the idea behind batman forever be excellent and could have be easily realise by a competent director a it turn out this be not to be the case apparently warner brother executive be disappoint with how dark this second batman film from tim burton turn out apart from the idiocy of expect anything else from burton and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into an homage to the sixty tv series i fail to understand how batman return can be consider at all disappointing true it be not quite the equal of the first film though it repair all the minor deficiency of style find in batman a weak script that split the antagonism between not just two but three character invite unflattering comparison to the masterful pairing of keaton and jack nicholson a the joker in the first film yet for all this it remain a gorgeously dark film true to the way the batman be always mean to be and highly satisfying michael keaton return a the batman and his alter ego bruce wayne tangle with nouveau riche tycoon max schreck christopher walken name in honour of the s german silent actor his partnerincrime oswald cobblepot the penguin danny devito in illiant makeup reminiscent of laurence olivier richard iii and selina kyle the catwoman michelle pfeiffer whom wayne romance both a himself and a the batman the four principal turn in excellent performance especially walken and devito while together keaton and pfeiffer explore the darker side of double identities there be some intriguing concept in this film about the only weakness i can really point out be a certain limpness to the script in some place which i think be due mostly to the way this film be a fourcornered fight there simply isnt enough time to properly explore whats go on nevertheless this be a damn good film i highly recommend watch this in conjunction with the first and then weep for how good the series could have be have it continue under burton and keaton  n  the quick and the undead be finally the first movie to actually render it own storyline null and void it be essentially one gigantic plot hole aside from that the acting be quite bad character motivation nonexistent or unbelievable and there wasnt a single character worth hang our hat on the most interesting cast member who have great potential to be a dark horse protagonist get snuffed halfway through the proceedings what the quick and the undead do serve a be an excellent example of how to do good colortiming it look excellent when you take into account budget considerations unfortunately it play out like a guy get his hand on a hundred grand and watch a few western most notably the good the bad and the ugly and then just throw a bunch of element haphazardly into a movie     you know they have movie where character do this do it fit here no but who care they do it in other movie so i should do it here maybe a good view for burgeon cinematographer and colorist firstyear filmschoolers otherwise a mustmiss  n  i be stun by this film afterwards i didnt even want to see any film for a long time any other film would be so unsatisfying by comparison for many it may be the bad of antonioni very slow without an engaging conventional story line microscopic examination of human emotion and interaction and the bad of wenders verbose confused transcendentalism it be compose of short distinct episode link by wenders typical meander heros stream of consciousness so it doesnt produce the temporary oblivion of escapist cinema but for fan the bad be the best and the disjointed story line be sketch a single poetic image that stretch across the film wenders and antonioni create a discourse between their segment that seek out the heart of thing  n  be i the only person who think that the entire forensics and scene of crime community in the usa must detest this almighty slap in their face a rookie cop be first to a crime scene where her back up be so slow to respond that she have time to send the kid who find the body to the local store to buy a disposable camera by the time he return still no senior cop socos or other assistance for the lovely jolie this be new york isnt it it have start rain and she get to work photograph the evidence only after shed stood in front of an amtrak to stop it disturb the scene i want to know the name of that camera a the photograph be so incredibly detail that no amount of zoom in distort the image the horror continue not in the film itself pretty ordinary im afraid but in the lincoln rhyme character a play by mr washington this man be a highly dedicate forensic crime scene examiner with year of experience who instead of the highly trained but invisible local crime scene examiner entrust the work to an untrained cop a rookie cop who proceed to find the very obviously place clue and move them before photograph them thus contaminate every item and make dna profile well nigh impossible now that be a ight idea eh i know one should be able to suspend disbelief to a degree but those who say this film be intelligent must have entirely disengage their ability to think in order to find this film believable i have give this film for the superb acting of denzel washington and for miss jolies lip which be the only item require my disbelief to be suspend  n  the one of the most remarkable scifi movie of the millennium not only a movie but an incredible future vision this movie establish a new standard of s f movie hail and kill  n  this be the second hitchcock film to appear on the list and the second hitchcock film ive see in full the first be rope which i really enjoy with saboteur hitchcock be more room to roam free whereas rope take place all in one room i didnt enjoy this one as much a rope but thats not say this be a bad film it just seem like an average flick that could have be something more it seem like a film hitchcock would make a a eak in between his more serious one a a thriller i feel it fail to really get my on the edge of my seat or engage with the lead character who be run around the state the climax of the film feel like a miss opportunity to really amp up the tension the sound design be almost non existent you can hear their dialogue and a bit of the environment around them but the important thing be miss the stitch rip apart from the sleeve the need of music to amp of the tension all miss intentional no doubt yet it lack the emotional punch one would want from such a scene then it end auptly leave you empty inside the film doesnt feel like it should either they be almost globe trot from place to place yet it feel more confine the script itself be very average and seem to go about the more obtuse way to get the plot moving the performance be there but nothing amazing everyone play their part to script word on the page the relationship between the two lead be weak and need more work the one stand out be otto kruger who have that rich ego evil persona down pat in the end i want more from this one i understand it one of hitchcock least exciting film but i do have a good time watch it i can recommend it just not enthusiastically  n  it be always difficult to ing a page book down to a three hour film i read the book before and i find the bbc production deal with this difficulty in the best way possible the quality of the book havent be lose the dense and lively depiction of a fingersmith patchwork family in london in the s the cold and obscene cruelty in which maud be ought up the characterization of different social group by different way of speak the unexpected and surprising twist of the story the way the film make the spectator look different at the same scene when they be tell first from sue point of view then from mauds one the main actor do very good and especially the grow love between the two woman be convincingly develop with a first culmination in a very tender love scene between the two and finally forgive all the evil they be ready to do and do to each other because they still love each other for each of her book the author sarah water have thoroughly investigate what life be like in british th century while in tip the velvet it be the world of the vaudeville theater and the beginning of social movement in affinity the dreadful reality of woman penitentiary and the fashionable evocation of spirit in fingersmith she depict the public ceremony of hang people in london and the inhuman treatment of person suppose or declare disturbed in asylum base on the reading of source and scientific research this be very well transfer to the film so that the corresponding scene show a high grade of historic truth i highly recommend this film production because it offer three hour of colorful victorian atmosphere vivid emotion and suspense  n  this be one of my all time favorite cheap corny vampire b movie calvin klein underwear model     oh i mean stefan the good vampire return to transylvania to ascend the throne of vampiric royalty but manicureimpaired and eternally drool half other radu have other plan have kill their father the vampire king radu now set his sight on stefan stefans new mortal girlfriend michelle and her two pretty friend and the allpowerful bloodstone okay the scenery be beautiful and it should be a it be shoot on location in transylfrickenvania for gosh sakes the actress be no great shake and stefan the heroic vampire be about as charming a a refrigerated fireplace poker but who care theres only one reason to watch this movie and his name be radu he a physical homage to nosferatu and he have the best line in the movie all speak in the raspy voice of a man who smoke ten pack of cigarette a day the cemetery festival scene be one of the best scene in the film a radu slowly approach the camera and reveal his grin slobber face for the world to see i find myself cheer him on a he collect victim and taunt his perfect other but maybe im just a sicko questionable taste in men aside i highly recommend this film to vampire enthusiast it original it fun and radu be one of the best vampire ive see in a long time     much more fun than the stiff tragic whine undead at that endlessly grace the horror screen these day radu enjoy his sadism and never apologize he what a vampire should be  n  let me first off say that i be a believer of ghost and i do indeed know they exist i have have enough experience with them to know they be there what i hate be the people who ing the bible and religion into all of this people forget there be more than one bible thousand of religion and belief and different way to interpret what be say in the bible not everyone believe in god and not everyone believe in stereotypical religion religion do not make everything fact one of the thing i should mention in the bible that many do not know be that even the most rampant bible thumper be eaking the very rule write within      you be suppose to never wear more than one faic at one time slavery be ok and you may murder your neighbor under certain circumstance none of this oh that be the old testament and now we have the new testament if the bible be the word of god and can not be changed  there should be no change or version religion be full of misinterpretation mixed fact and people who so blindly follow it that there be no other way the excuse these say blind follower use be either pathetic or they themselves can not explain the discrepancy properly and instead use excuse hand down to them from either their pastor or teacher but anyhow onto the review i be a decent fan of ghost hunter and when i hear this show be come soon i be pretty excited and think it have some potential as much a i like watch ghost hunter i do not like some of their member and i do not like the way they can dismiss a place a be haunt yet can not explain anything that be go on just because your investigation equipment do not pick it up do not mean the camera film the show do not i be glad they be skeptical but it like they do not understand that just because you do not get anything on your recorder and film do not make the place haunt or not if ghost be that easy to capture it would be know a a fact not a belief it more of a right place at the right time kind of thing as well a if there be something there what make you think it go to perform for you this show be kind of silly it usually boring and there be lot of talk lot of psychic yet hardly anything happen the main guy filter narration be usually either bore to listen to or be basically not needed also the reliance on psychic be too abundant a i believe very few of them be actually gift silvia brown be one i definitely believe in but most be sometimes hard to believe i really want to like this show but of the few i have see i have yet to be terribly impressed  n  for a long time the menagerie be my favorite star trek episode though in recent year it have be eclipse by city on the edge of forever what i use to prefer about menagerie be that it more hardcore star trek with this fascinate backstory to the thencurrent trek storyline i still think it fairly ingenious the way gene roddenberry incorporate the original pilot into a twopart episode though the new part of the story be largely an excuse for kirk and a few others and u to watch the pilot the idea of spock be courtmartialed be a clever one you can poke hole in the plot if you want for instance give the talosians mindcontrol ability and captain pike condition why be it even necessary to physically ing pike back to their planet and there be other confusing question about pike and commodore mendez     best to not think too hard about the detail and just enjoy sts only twoparter  n  coen brotherswannabe from writerdirector paul chart rely far too much on idea lift from other good movie yet do manage to create a creepy atmosphere that keep one watching robert forster cut loose a never before play a psychopathic psychiatrist ha ha who go on a kill spree in the desert the film be unusual but in it attempt to keep one step ahead of the audience it become alienate and offputting with a role for amanda plummer that be downright humiliate an admittedly avura finale many quirky bit of businessand forster look great in the nudemake this a curiosity item nothing more veteran moviedirector irvin kershner produce and maybe should direct a well could paul chart be a pseudonym    from       n  when it be release this film cause a sensation i watch it and be thrill beautiful usually young naked woman film in the classy style we know so well from director hamilton photography his photograph never become porn and the same be true for this movie today i saw it again and be bitterly disappoint the soft core in extremely slow pace scene all film with some vaseline on the lens actually be all there be there be no real story the character remain beautiful and beautifully filmed body but they be not real creature with a soul actually nothing happen it be like hamilton be photograph use move picture rather than still and this get so boring after a while i even didnt watch the whole thing the second time for i fell vast asleep that be all that remain of this masterpiece it be a very good sleeping pill and you will never become addicted to it back then out of now out of  n  largely forgettable tale in which mercenary kerman employer agren travel into the jungle in search of agrens miss sister despite it connection to the cannibal movie family this film be more of an extreme version of rene cardonas guyana crime of the century lenzi clearly aim to exploit the at that time topical jonestown massacre by depict a rogue self righteous zealot with a penchant for bigamy and just a hint of megalomania play with ruthless intensity by ivan rassimov lead his motley crew flock into self inflict oblivion with sister in toe kerman agren attempt to stop the rot but after several fail coup they end up flee into the green inferno only to run afoul the local and their notorious appetites one in a string of excessive gore fests that emerge in the late seventies early eighty where every new addition seem to engage in a oneupmanship contest with it predecessor by attempt to contrive the most gory and graphic display ever ought to motion picture this inferior instalment employ all the motif and gimmick of the others but with much less success was it the so called amazonian native who look like they be bollywood reject this film be make on location in sri lanka or the inept decapitation and castration scene that seriously diminish the authenticity that be apparent in cannibal holocaust you can decide without spoil the conclusion it appear a though lenzi put more emphasis in his shock and awe climax than in the basic requirement for a cohesive end where all loose end be resolve most unsatisfying as with the others where the extent of the graphic depiction of violence toward human be limit thankfully the filmmaker have spar no extreme in inflict the bad possible cruelty on hapless animal in their pursuit of the most sadistic shock unfortunately the only thing shock about this film be that it rate a mention among others of the ilk that deal with the subject matter more convincingly if there be any redeemable feature at all kerman be an affable if somewhat onedimensional lead man and his bevy of scantily clad costars agren lai and senatore provide some visual respite from the relentless slaying  n  get smart should be title get stupid there be not one funny line or gag in the entire film this film be so bad it make the austin power film look shakespearean a few more film like this and steve carell can kiss his career goodbye a for anne hathaway what be she do in this film shes a good actress but be just plain terrible the writing be pathetically lame there be not one funny clever or witty line there be not one good sight gag the directing be terrible comedy relies on time someone should tell the director that every line that be suppose to be funny and isnt be deliver with absolutely the bad sense of comic timing ive ever see star  n  herculis puaro be in general a well establish hero we know well from book and movie this movie or this story dont work and i felt it not agathas mistake the cast isnt good the actor be over exaggerate and make foolish gesture the costume be so clean and tidy that everything even arab clothes look fake and for the serious spectator who think twice this movie can be see a a comedy instead of mystery drama the actor playing herculis puaro be do a nice job but nothing fantastic the scene be a say before perfect and look fake the story be not very enchant although a mystery of murder but who care about the death of a loony and vicious blond woman in the iraqi desert the victim be not likable  n  how can so many blunder decision can be make all that waste of resource it an idiotic story to begin with but theres no need to make it worse a loose interpretation be you kid it diminish my regard for voight and coburn i hope they be pay well  n  this be by far the bad movie ive ever see and thats compare to alexander fortress and the new world i should go back to blockbuster and ask for my money back along with compensation a it be a truly traumatic experience for the first ten minute i be change the zoom on my widescreen tv because the actor seem to be out of screen i didnt think it be possible to make such a bad film in this day and age i be wrong while type this message ive thought of a good reason to buy this movie a joke present at xmas im blame the mr for this one a she pick it thank babe be warn          a true shocker all round  n  if youve read mother night and enjoy it so much a i do that you just have to see the movie understand that you have to understand a fundamental element of vonnguts write that beyond his story lie vonnegut himself and that you cant put a human mind on the screen his whit and humor just can not be transcribe by a screenplay or even the best acting performance i believe that this movie exceed in ask the key question that vonnegut pose in his book but those frequent cynical moment of satire find on the page be not find on the screen do this mean that the movie miss the mark of course not in my opinion the movie succeed because it do not try to recreate the experience of read the book this be not a medium for those too lazy to turn a page it succeed because it take the fundamental element of a story create by one of america true artistic treasure and present it in a a framework without pretense ive see other movie version of vonnegut book where the director obviously try to channel vonnegut genius and lose grip on his own craft i would not place this movie a one of the best ive see but it stand on it own leg a one well worth watch by take vonneguts voice out of the movie narration or try to insert it however it can mother night tell his story illiantly and preserve the storys fundamental lesson without confusion distraction or disappointment  n  this be one of the bad movie ive ever see not only that it be a comedy which isnt funny but it also very badly make with an over the top direction full of unnecessary split screen and other effects the two hero with their fantasy language be just annoy and it confuse me quite a lot that they touch each others genitals all the time but the bad of all that nonsense be the cheap attempt to give that movie some appeal by refer to german history and to show sensitive aspect of the hero which find it climax in show how erkan and stefan cure a mentally ill woman with their joyful lifestyle but i hadnt expect anything good by director michael bully herbig who also make two not funny tvshows a not funny western movie and a nearly not funny sfcomedy movie but erkan and stefan have be just a little well in some of their standup program for me the only good thing about the movie be alexandra neldel who be very beautiful to me  n  i sit through this on tv hoping because of the name in it that it would be worth the time     but dear gussie whoever think this script be worth produce the basic idea be excellent but the execution be appallingly bad with a constantly illogical sequence of scene an end that be almost laughably melodramatic and poor rock hudson wanders through this with an understandably confused look on his slightly sag face look like a bad b movie from the s      n  a number of contributor have mention the age difference between stewart and novak she be and he be when this movie be release i think that the difference didnt matter for a suspense drama like vertigo but it do matter for a romantic comedy we can easily understand that be why his character would be attract to hers but it less clear why hers would be attract to his still the movie work a a light romantic fantasy the scene where she star at him across the cat head with her dark paintedon eyeows flare and the sound of her humming and the cat purring be true magic it a little jarring therefore when the scene shift to the top of the flatiron building and we see the age difference very sharply a he emaces her she reach up to run her finger through his hair but stop that motion and just ushes her fingertip lightly against his toupee  n  family problem abound in real life and that be what this movie be about love can hold the member together through out the ordeal and trial and that be what this movie be about one man daddy have the maturity and fortitude to sustain the family in the face of adversity the kid grow upone all be it in the hard way to realize that no matter how old they or a parent be the parent still love their child and be willing to provide them a cushion when they fall all the actor portray their character do outstanding performance yes i shed a tear along the way know i have have similar experience both a a young adult and later a a parent this true to life be one which every young adult and parent would do well to see although some will not realize it until they too be parent a must see for those who care about their family  n  the only conceivable flaw of this film be it title please stop compare it to the first i do in my previous review only to separate it from the first if you havent see the movie and be curious totally forget about the first and invent a different name for this there be nothing alike and have a mood all it own this be a great exponent of screwy mids comedy i seriously doubt such big name in this cast do the movie because they be oke or even want to remake the first anybody who ever want to give a kick to the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus i maintain the only reason this be in the imdb bottom be because of it title i usually hate movie like these i e adam sandler will farrell farrelly os     but this movie just keep me laugh hysterically i dunno maybe it like a bad relationship i cant get out of or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure either way this be the single most underrated movie of the s behind the stunt man robert stack we love you  n  salva and his pal bigardo have be at the margin of the law during most of their life we see them panhandle in a car of the underground where their pitch to get donation be so lame no one give them anything salva who be a hardened petty criminal doesnt even have any redeeming quality that be until he discover a reality show on television that give him the idea of what to do next religion and show business prove to be a win combination something that salva capitalize on he and bigardo have be in jail after the accidental death of a priest that be critical of the duo salva show he be a natural for the reality show he transform himself into a christlike figure who be an instant success in the program espe who be a nononsense woman who be show producer cant escape from the way salva pay her unusual attention ultimately salva be the victim of his own success in the end jordi molla whose first directorial job this movie be have some success in the way the film satirize the role of television spain which be vulnerable to these type of program have see it share of the bizarre which be what the director felt be an assault on the view public and want to set his story from the point of view of the people that be make a fortune out of the naive audience the ensemble cast have some good moment in the film mr  molla like any actor who decide to direct his first feature would have be more effective concentrating on the picture in front of the camera candela pena a good actress be one of the best reason for watch the movie juan carlos villedo david gimenez cacho franco francescoantonio florinda chico and the rest respond well to the new director  n  these kinda movie just dont get the credit they deserve this be my nd all time favorite movie stand by me be st  the reason i watch this movie be because wil wheaton be in it and he be my most favorite person in the whole world and i think he do an amazing job in this movie and so do sean astin i just watch it last night actually and it just amaze me everything in the movie be very exceptional the script the act the screenplay i be on the edge of my seat of the time and if my mom wasnt in the room i would have absolutely ball whenever joey trotta wil wheaton die i do not see that come at all i be real surprised when i hear that it wasnt real popular back in the s  i be bear a few year after it come out so of course i didnt go see it in the theater but im sure i would have if i would have be alive if any of my friend watch this they would be like uhh okay but thats just cause their not cool enough to appreciate work like this if you havent see this movie or be want to watch something that be the bomb this be the movie for you to watch  n  a a bigtime prince fan of the last three to four year i really cant believe ive only just get round to watch purple rain the and new disc anniversary special edition lead me to buy it wow i be really look forward to watch it but i wasnt prepare for just how electric it actually be princes musical performance throughout the movie be nothing short of astound he really have the move in this one i be very familiar from repeat listens with the classic purple rain album and all it song but to see them in the context of the movie completely alter your perception of the tune and lyric like computer blue the beautiful one when dove cry and purple rain itself there be something indescribably hypnotise about the scene where prince and the revolution perform the closing song baby im a star and i would die for u show how much energy and sheer talent prince be imming with in his mids he overflow it blow me away it even make michael jackson seem inanimate even in his peak years prince show you how to win the girl of your dream drive her to a lake make her jump in then drive off absolutely hilarious stuff in hindsight some of the scene be very s and unintentionally hilarious but this add to the film overall charm morris day be the cool cat on the block and hilarious and when his group the time perform the bird you get to see morris day and jerome benton light up the stage minneapolis funk style i love their dancing in this bit and how benton provide morris with a mirror midperformance i already cant wait to watch it again i really cant extra be terrific particularly see a young eddie murphy prebeverly hill cop admit he be a prince groupie  n  a good ol boy film be almost require to have moonshine car chase a storyline that have a vague resemblance to plot and at least one very pretty country gal barefoot with short short and a low top the pretty gal be here dress in designer jean but the redneck prerequisites stop there jimmy dean be a natural a a sausage spokesman but a a tough guy former sheriff he come up way short big john be big but he isnt convince with the bad part of his moniker bugeyed jack elam be a hoot a always and bo hopkins have be play this same part for decade ned beatty also do his part in a small role     but there be no story it smell more like an episode of in the heat of the night than a feature film cornball cornpone with easily predictable sentiment perhaps the most glaring problem with this movie be charlie daniel sing the theme you know the one it be make famous by     jimmy dean  n  after several extremely well rating to the point of superb i be extremely pleased with the film the film be dark move the anger the pain the guilt and a very extremely convince demon i have initially expect to see many special effect and like a lover caress it blow me away with the subtlety and the rightness of it brian i be again blow away with your artistry with the telling of the story and your care of the special effect you will go a long way my friend i will definitely be the president of your fan club eric etebari the best actor award be the number one choice you make jr  lopez look like a child compare to kasadya overall the act story line the high quality filming and awesome effect it be fantastic i just wish it be longer i be look forward to the dreamless with extremely high expectation  n  but it be kinda hilarious at least if you grow up on weird al like i do it a mockumentary about his life and career begin with superstardom and go back to trace the origin it uneven in place but some of the segment be still very funny particularly when he go to japan although it not quite a emotionally textured a lose in translation and he doesnt find love however fleet he do capture in a bottle the absolutely bizarre cultural melange that be tokyo street life perhaps weird al isnt recognize a the insightful cultural commentator that he be perhaps a rise by any other name would smell just a sweet still this be a funny movie  n  one of the two best film of the year a well film well write well put together film with an outstanding cast lau ching wan and his friend dayo wong chi wa anthony wong chau sun francis ng chun yu jordan chan siu chun cheung man tat have great chemistry before the film and their friendship show in their performance theresa lee play her comedic role well though much like a female version of michael wong her gag seem to be the foreign born chinese surround by native hkers and i find myself cheer for innovative explosive scene something i havent do since the fan boy take over alt asianmovies and john woos hardboiled sure the end be expect but i feel well cheer for cop than a bunch of young gang member highly enjoyable  n  i manage to see this at the new york international film festival in november with my boyfriend we be both quite impress with the complexity of the plot and find it to be emotionally move it be very well direct with strong imagery the visual effect be amaze especially for a short it have an original fantasy approach to a very real and serious topic this film be about a young girl who be visit by a demon offering to help her situation with her abusive father there be also a surprise twist at the end which catch me off guard this lean towards the gothic feel i would love to see this a a full feature film carrie  n  why else would he do this to me not that i expect dean cain to produce hit movie or even decent movie i saw lois and clark i be aware of just how     good dean cain is obviously this be gon na be a cheesey flick and each cheesey flick have it own special way to make you scratch your head i will not call these spoiler a you cant really spoil this movie any more than it already is to begin with     why be that a fake helicopter i mean     why how come that one scientist be from chicago and that other scientist be from la and neither one could be any more eastern european if they try how hard would it have be to get either an american actor or just change that lame state sheet the movie provide u with to say those people arent american why be there occasion when the movie give u a slug line we get helipadday and then mess hallday later on and then thats it who care about the timeline to be honest who care about it even when they mention it but i guess thats beside the point does a movie really get good if you be able to view it through multiple split screen the answer be no that dragon sure can walk down that hall  over  and over     and over      and over     who on earth be responsible for one of the bad ending in film history it be straight out of scooby doo oh the dragon dead now     say wan na get dinner sure but not at some chinese place      with dragon in the name ah ha ha ha ha ha ha haha ha i use to be superman aha ha ha ha ha fade to blackmy god it make me cringe it be so stupid but never fear  even though the whole building explode     and no one be leave alive  for some reason theres a second untouched unmanned lab that survive pretty well so they can make a sequel hurray for u all  n  minimal script minimal character development minimal steady camera maximum stretch scene maximum headache induce jerky zoom maximum character walk around in the wood do nothing up until the time flash on the screen of pm you can fast forward and miss nothing since there be three hunter who we know nothing about do nothing to be fair the movie do have some string music that be interest so perhaps a music video would have be the way to go with this unfortunately that be not to be and what should have be a twenty minute short be stretch beyond belief forget about trigger man i know i be try to merk  n  a wonderful film ahead of it timei think so in the eighty it be all about win greed be good remember that one i have see this film more that time to me this be a real desert island film i keep watch because there be always something more to learn about these flawed character that i just love jessica tandy and hume cronin be simply wonderfulalso beverly dangelo beau bridge come in at a close second dont get me wrong there be many more great performance in this film and it be also the way it be write that make it for me and i hope you a film that you will want to see over and over i think tv show like northen exposure and now earl owe a lot to this film but remember it be not a tom cruise film  n  it get switch off before the opening credit have even finish appear the first joke be just so appallingly lame and dreadfully act that it have to go you shouldnt really decide to watch this base on my review or not i saw so little of it i shouldnt even really be comment but suddenly it all become clear why the video shop guy be snigger at u pay money to see it couldnt they have just make earnest do dallas  n  this be one of the more unromantic movie i have ever seen casting richard gere be just too old look for romantic lead role anymore diane look a bit eager to please and frown as usual but she seem unconvinced by the romance herself support cast not too memorable story the medical drama he have to deal with be unconvincing and be not interest the story be weak not enough happen to make a movie about there be nothing new to say or no new way to say it here the setting be a little bleak and the house it be set in be unattractive not destine to be a great one to remember  n  only light spoiler in here steal sinatra be a halfslapstick comedy about dimwit kidnapper dimwit victim and a few other sidestories throw in to eat up some time you will see some poor performance all around in this movie the drama be force and the humor make no sense whether youre watch the kidnapper threaten the victim who wont shut up or a victim father respond to the criminal death threat with care for some tea none of it be believable this quite comfortably fit into the wannabe movie category you will also be listen to a repetitive goofy music track throughout pretty much the entire movie it quite unprofessional and add nothing it really just a sad attempt at make an achingly unfunny movie seem somewhat witty however if youre able to look past all of this and suspend a lot of disbelief you might be entertain by the adequate storyline i vote  n  yes this be one of those movie so terrible so insipid so trite that you will not be able to stop laughing i have watch comedy good comedy and laugh less than my wife and i laugh at this movie the other comment give the idea well enough the character be so unpleasant you cheer the rat on the effect be so poorly do you wonder whose elementary school art class be in charge the act oh the acting talk about tired dialogue and embarrass pauses but the rat yes the big rat why we didnt get to see the rat until the end rather surprise me often the big one isnt show until the end because the budget be limited and good effect chew up so much money i surmise however that in this case the big rat be hide until the end because the filmmaker be ashamed that the best they have be a guy run around dress up like a woodchuck with thirdworld dentistry the most sublime part of the whole movie be the elevator scene after figure out that the rat couldnt stand loud noise migraine from the bad act the main dude rig up a fire alarm to send the rat into a frenzy if youve ever want to see a pair of rat waltz while blood squirt out of their head like a geyser this film be for you really you need to rent it and see for yourself but not for more than    ok  n  well where do i begin my story i go to this movie tonight with a few friend not know more than the actor that be in it and that it be suppose to be a horror movie well i figure out within the first minute what a poor decision i have make go out see this movie the plot be crap and so be the script the line be horrible to the point that people in the audience be laugh hysterically the cast couldnt have be more plastic look even some of the scene seem like they should have be make much quicker     like they drag on for no particular reason very poor editing all in all this movie be a giant waste of time and money boo  n  this be one of my favorite betty white and leslie neilson sparkle in this romantic comedy one be a business executive who reevaluate life base on the expectation of her death within a year the other be a playboy who have tire of golddigging young woman and seek a relationship with a vital mature woman if youve get silver in your hair and or romance in your heart microwave the popcorn curl up with your honey and prepare yourself for a treat  n  follow directly from where the story leave off in part one the second half which set about tell the inevitable downfall and much more grim side of the man legacy be exactly a such in direct contrast to the first feature part two represent a shift from che the pride and glory of a revolutionised country to che  struggling liberator of a country to which he have no previous tie the change of set isnt just aesthetic from the autumn and spring grey of the woodland come a change of tone and heart to the feature replace the optimism of the predecessor with a cynical battered and uised reality align to an all new struggle yet a che would go on to say himself  such a struggle be best told exactly a that  a struggle while part one certainly help document that initial surge to power that the revolutionary guerrilla acquire through just that part two take a much more refined callous and bleak segment of ches life and ambition and give it an assertive portrayal that be both poignant and tragic in a tangible easy to grasp manner while the movie tone in some regard do stray off and differ quite drastically from part one however there still remain that same document approach take a month ago that avoids melodrama and faication as much a possible this somewhat distant cold approach to tell ches story and struggle will no doubt turn some viewer off indeed i still remain reserved about whether or not the feature itself should have be name after one man  if anything the entirety of che take a a whole delivers a tale that go beyond mere biography and instead document a man struggle alongside those who help carry him along the way by no mean do soderbergh try to paint a humanistic portrait here akin to what hirschbiegel do with der untergang half a decade ago excuse the ironic contrast che be a slow moving reserve and meditative approach to tell a history lesson that just happen to be narrate by the one man who   arguably conduct the whole thing yet by move from the lush green landscape of cuba and retreat to the bleak decay backdrop of bolivia for part two the story do inevitably take on a distinctly contrast tone that doesnt feel too disjoint from it predecessor but do enough to give it it own reference point here the basic structure of part one be echo back  theres the initial struggle the battle the fall comrade and the recruiting of those to replace them all the while we see some glimpse of the man behind the movement yet a anyone with the vague idea of the actual history behind the feature will know part two be destine to end on a much more underwhelming and disquiet note this difference in combination with the similarity to part one make a compelling and memorable whole by all mean both could be digest one their own and kudos to soderbergh for achieve a such and enjoy a they be but take a one statement che delivers exactly what it set out to achieve indeed everything that make part one the treat that it be one month prior be still evident here from the subtle yet engross performance from the central cast to the slow building realistically structure combat scenes  the drama inherent to the character on screen be just a vague and indiscernible but with a feature such a this part two once again prove that avoid such element dont necessarily hurt a film when there be enough plot and reflection on other element to keep the viewer engage in fact upon write this review i be at odds a to whether or not to simply add a paragraph or two to my initial review for part one and title the review a a whole yet i felt that to do so would only serve to disillusion those who may sit down to watch the entirety of both film consecutively with that say i can not rightfully decree whether or not che hold up to the task of engage an audience for it sprawl four hour plus runtime but upon view both segment i can at least attest to each part ability to do just that with a reflective intricate screenplay combine with endlessly mesmerise photography and nuanced performance that do justice to the movie character without draw attention to themselves che part two be every bit a compelling and rewarding a it predecessor but this time with a tragic but uplifting reaffirming conclusion fit for the history page of film a review by jamie robert ward http   www invocus net  n  sometimes it hard to be a pirate                     but by golly miss jean peter have a lot of fun try and it showsparticularly during her first spot of friendly swordplay with blackbeard mr thomas gomez eminently hissable when the sheer joy of performing be plain on her face with fifty year of hindsight feminist seem intent on grab this movie a some sort of an anthem for the empowerment of woman in a male dominate society but i have serious doubt that either m tourneur or miss peter have any such concept in their head at the time it be an excitingentertaining family film with absolutely no pretensionshidden meaning or alternative agenda it be fun m louis jourdan be both winsome and treacherous a her love interest mr herbert chapman be wise and philosophical a the wise and philosophical doctor mr james robertson justice be just a tad unbelievable a the bosun but it be miss peter who stay in the memory wilfully adolescentilliteratetough but vulnerablewonderfully agileand ultimatelycourageousshe be everybodys idea of a lady pirate there be a definite window of opportunity for her in feisty costume role that she do not choose to seize it be a matter of some regret  n  i have never see a film by john cassavetes up until two year ago when i first saw the killing of a chinese bookie in a berlin cinema which i find interest to put it diplomatically but not so special i instantly want to see more of his work since then i tried with an emphasis on tried watch his other work shadow in particular i must admit it take me a a while before i actually enjoy the film at first the unpolished raw and improvised way cassavetes it be shoot put me off somewhat and i thought of it a an original absolutely but flaw and dated experiment but now upon review these little imperfection make it look so fresh even today shot on a minimal budget of with a skeleton six person crew shadow offer an observation of the tension and life of three sibling in an africanamerican family in which two of the three sibling ben ben carruthers and lelia lelia goldoni be lightskinned and able to pass for white cassavetes demand that the actor retain their real name to reflect the actual conflict within the group but saw the film a be concern with human problem a oppose imply to racial one cassavetes shoot the film in ten minute take and jag edit a reaction against seamless hollywood production value cassavetes main inspiration at least in the cinematic style the film be shoot be the italian neorealists whilst also profess admiration for welles pioneer spirit the use of amateur and improvisation might resemble some of the italian neorealist director but with his bebop score by charles mingus an shafi hadi the film feel very different very american unlike anything make before really the song with the feathered girl i feel like a lollypop or something feel like light year back to me ancient history but no matter how date it might look it still make a delightful time capsule of late fifty new york today i think it this be one of the first film make aspire filmmaker realize they could shoot an independent film without hollywood improvise and without a real budget seymour cassel who act and be involve in shadow claim it be jules dassins the naked city that be the first and inspire them all but i think this be the one that really open the eye of aspire independent american filmmakers camera obscura  n  base on an actual story john boorman show the struggle of an american doctor whose husband and son be murder and she be continually plague with her loss a holiday to burma with her sister seem like a good idea to get away from it all but when her passport be steal in rangoon she could not leave the country with her sister and be force to stay back until she could get i d paper from the american embassy to fill in a day before she could fly out she take a trip into the countryside with a tour guide i try find something in those stone statue but nothing stir in me i be stone myself suddenly all hell oke loose and she be catch in a political revolt just when it look like she have escape and safely board a train she saw her tour guide get beat and shoot in a split second she decide to jump from the move train and try to rescue him with no thought of herself continually her life be in danger here be a woman who demonstrate spontaneous selfless charity risk her life to save another patricia arquette be beautiful and not just to look at she have a beautiful heart this be an unforgettable story we be taught that suffer be the one promise that life always keep  n  this pm entertainment production be lace with enough bullet to make john woo say enough already of course it isnt nearly as beautiful a woo can deliver but it get the exploitive job do in minute eric phillips don wilson be an undercover cop in the near future when his wife be frame for murder the governor by a team use a lookalike cyborg it be up to eric to clear her name wilson get to pull van damme duty a he play the heroic lead and his evil cyborg doppelganger why the academy fail to take notice be beyond me be a pm production there be ton of car chase explode car in the first minute and shoot out i particularly like the van that flip in midair before it even come close to touch an explode truck my other favorite bit involve a neighborhood girl come over to perfect her karate in don simulator it be merely a chance to show off some cheapo lawnmower man effect circa  n  shallow grave begin with either a tribute or a rip off of the shower scene in psycho im lean toward rip off after that it get bad and then surprisingly get well almost to the point of be original bad acting and amateurish directing bog down a fairly interesting little story but the film already surpass many in the yankee come down south to get kill by a bunch of redneck genre because it be actually shoot in the south a group of college girl head to ft  lauderdale for summer vacation and be waylay in georgia by a flat tire after get off the main road note to yankee stay on the highway when you go to florida sue ellen lisa stahl have to pee so she head into the wood when she finally find a good spot to do her business she witness the local sheriff tony march strangle his mistress merry rozelle to death note to yankee do not wander off into the wood when in the south not because you might witness a murder but you may run across a marijuana plantation this be the point where the story not the movie actually come close to be good while tony march will never have to practice his oscar speech his sheriff dean become a creepy facsimile of a normal guy tear by what he have do and what he must do tom law be likable a deputy scott and be as authentic a southern deputy a ive see since walton goggins deputy steve naish in house of corpses a few scene in the movie be worth the mention the girl stop at a bbq in south carolina and display their racism when a big black guy check them out sue ellen run into a barn to hide behind some hay bale and in a shockingly realistic moment a large snake be hide in the hay with her and in the strange scene sheriff dean make like he about to rape patty carol cadby and tell her to take off her clothes dean have turn the radio up to drown out the noise of what hes about to do the preacher on the radio need to go back and read his bible his sermon be about how jezebel be save by the blood of jesus christ i feel sorry for this preacher flock jezebel be in the old testament a few thousand year before christ be bear and by no mean be she one of the five people you be go to meet in heaven  n  although this film have have a lot of praise i personally find it bore there be some nice brasilian sunset and the character be believable but the story of how they interrelate even if very unusual by our standard be not interesting enough to sustain a movie this long the central woman take up with one man after another in a close knit way and put the interest of her child first a the tolerance of the various men be stretch we see their character develop the story unfold with dignity and aid by excellent act it be a rare glimpse into the brasilian hinterland far from the city but hardly exciting enough to keep one eye open for  n  no mention if ann river siddons adapt the material for the house next door from her s novel of the same title or someone else do it this lifetimelike movie be direct by canadian director jeff woolnough have read the book a long time ago we decide to take a chance when the film show on a cable version of what be clearly a movie make for television you know that when the critical moment precede the commercial which of course one cant find in this version we watched the films star be lara flynn boyle who sport a new look that throw this viewer a curve because of the cosmetic transformation this actress have go through from the new eyeows to other part of her body ms  boyle be hardly recognizable a col kennedy the character at the center of the mystery this be not one of the actress well moment in front of the camera that go for the rest of the mainly canadian actor that deserve better the film have a feeling of a cross between desperate houswives with the stepford wife and other good know feature combine with a mild dose of creepiness the best thing about the movie be the house which serve a the setting  n  meticulously construct and perfectly play to the end of the earth be a simply astonishing voyage out of our reality and into another age based on william golding trilogy these three minute film chronicle the journey towards both australia and

else it a whole new world to discover  n  wow this be really not that good i would like to agree with the others in that at least the acting be good     it be but it be nothing special the movie be so precictable and i for one be sick of receive culture info through movie         n  i have to point out before you read this review that in no way be this a statement against iranian people     if you really want to read something into it than hopefully you see that im against politician in general     but if youre look to be offend     i cant help you not in iran a this movie be ban there see imdb trivia for this movie which be a shame because the movie be great would it not be for grbavica this movie would have win at the international film festival in berlin rightfully so it be the runnerup or second place if you will why because it be a movie about oppression it not even that this be a complete woman issue it be about the government try to keep the people down an analogy so clear that the government felt the need to ban the movie but by ban it nothing be resolve and or can they make this movie disappear another reviewer have a great summary line comedy about a tragedy that sum it up pretty well  n  i know little or nothing about astronomy but nevertheless i be at first a little sceptical about the plot of this movie it follow three child that be all bear during a solar eclipse and so have no emotion and thus naturally become ruthless serial killer the plot do sound ridiculous at first but once you realise that a solar eclipse block out saturn and a you know saturn be the emotion planet it all fall into place make complete sense and it then that you know you arent simply watch another silly s slasher with a pea ain plot thank god for that seriously though bloody birthday be base on a ridiculous premise but it more than make up for that with it originality have a bunch of kid go round slaughter people may not be the most ingenious masterstroke ever see in cinema but when give the choice between this and another dull friday the th clone i know what id choose also help the film out of the hole that some people would think it silly plot dug it into be the fact that it extremely entertaining many slasher become formulaic far too quickly and the audience end up watch simply to see some gore this film however keep itself go with some great creepy performance from the kid which hark back to creepy kid classic such a village of the damn a constant stream of sick humour and a small but impressive for the type of film dose of suspense and tension one thing that i like a lot about this movie be the vast array of weaponry there nothing bad than a slasher where the killer use the same weapon over and over again cough halloween cough but thats not the case here a bloody birthday find room for everything from skip rope to bow and arrows there wasnt any room for a chainsaw which be a huge shame but i suppose not every film can have a chainsaw in it  n  after many many year i saw again this beautiful love story think about how would i half a century after react to a film which make so many girl cry and sigh at that time when i be just an male adolescent try to understand woman behavior in a small city in brazil this time however what catch my attention in the film be something very different namely the insistence with which the physician dr  han suyin jennifer jones make clear to the journalist mark elliott william holden her special ethically condition a an eurasian in fact she be constantly put emphasis on this point in their relationship repeat she be willing to assume her love for him and carry it on in a occidental way provide that by do so she be not betray her chinese side it seem to the spectator that suyin be eagerly make effort to establish a very subtle conciliation between those two unstable and opposite aspect of her culture for they will immediately engage in overt conflict in her mind at a minimum failure in her attempt to control them therefore suyins attitude always leave poor elliott    a determine ave and extremely practical man    anxious and perplexed without know how much importance to give to her word for him whose love for her be plain and simple the situation be totally clear if we love each other let u make a couple and begin immediately a life together not so fast be what she seem verbally and nonverbally to answer him all the time in fact suyins chinese portion would never allow her such a level of pragmatism and a she go on and on reinforce this much aim equiliium between those two world inside herself she also frequently signal to him that also a very peculiar trait of chinese culture be deeply root in her mind namely the constant raid on the real world by invisible being from an spiritual or nonphysical world for suyin be always alert elliott about how dangerous be life not because of any objective and concrete threat a would be the perpetuation of the english colonialism or the eminence of a japanese invasion but due to the threat of plenty of cruel and harmful god and other mystical and mythical being over the poor fearful and vulnerable human beings in fact it look like a whole bunch of chinese deity be permanently on the watch to make people life totally miserable because of that mother must dress their precious male baby in girl clothes so that they be not take away by jealous god everyone should always be ready to make loud noise to send the cloud away in order to avoid their cover the sight of the moon peasant be advise that they should shout loudly the rice be bad the rice be bad to protect their crop from be steal by deity and in a funeral it be recommend that the dead family be isolate from the other people by curtain so that the god dont take advantage of their sorrow and fragility in other word suyin introduces u to a culture in which the supernatural have a real existence a if a rather disturb pantheon of malign and sadistic god be always on the verge of negatively interfere with the most banal act in anyones daily life as the story take place in hong kong in it should be clear that china really be at that time almost a semifeudal society while the country from which elliott have come from be not yet dominate by the fierce capitalism that launch by the usa after the first oil shock in take charge of the whole world therefore at least in one aspect both side of suyins eurasian personality be still much more innocent than they would be today a lot of history come into be since those old day a to china the main fact be that after several phase of a communist regime the country finally reach in the last two decade the condition of a very aggressive economy much more properly describe a state capitalism and what happen to that old spirituality that so much enthral suyin in hong kong in and with which she use to impress so much an impassioned elliott under that tree on the hill behind the hospital it be go completely go in ief if that story take place today elliott would not find it necessary to go to china to propose to suyin in the presence of the third uncle and her entire family in fact both men would now be incomparably closer to one another in their huge pragmatism talk business a usual  n  first and foremost i would like to say that before i watch this film i consider myself an accept individual someone that care about others appreciate others found no barely any judgment against other people and this film have i think change my life or viewpoint dramatically when i watch it i didnt know particularly what it be about i know it be about some type of forbidden relationship but other then that i be clueless and a i begin to see what be take place between these two wonderfully depicted character i be in shock disbelief confusion and surprise the first time i watch it i be blind blind to their love to their intimacy to their connection to their pureness a human being to their relationship i watch it a second time because i finally figure out how hypocritical i be be say to myself and others oh i accept all type of people and try not to judge them while still judge this wonderful and amazingly insightful story because of my fear i suppose the second time i watch this film i open those eye of mine that have stay close the first time and really look not at the type of taboo relationship part that id hear about all my life but simply at two human being in love and i love it i love the storyline i love the slightly oken yet strong individual people in the film i love the sharing of feeling and i love the strong bond create it be a really eye open beautifully do film that make me cry at time and i hope that people who read this and be go to watch the film eventually remember that everyone deserve love no matter what shape or form it be present in      n  zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz if imdb would allow oneword review thats what mine would be this film be originally intend only for kid and it would seem to be very tough go for adult or old kid to watch the film the sing the story everything be dull and wash outjust like this public domain print like other comedy team film with root in traditional kid story such a the awful snow white and the three stooge and the overrated babe in toyland this movie have limit appeal and just doesnt age well now that i think about it i seriously doubt that many kid nowadays would even find this film enjoyable so my advice be dont watch this film if you must watch an abbott and costello film almost any other one of their film except for a c go to mar would be an improvement  n  once in a while a movie will sweep along that stun you draw you in awe you and in the end leave you with a renew belief in the human race from the artistry form this be not it this be an action movie that lack convince action it stink rent something else  n  hard to imagine this film be base on a true story and how christy manage to accomplish the miracle be so heartstirring daniel daylewis be a chameleon really hard to imagine how much effort he have do to create this disabled character watch him on screen be a shocking and eathtaking experience the movie be not so pessimistic a i think before the story be kinda ight and intriguing christy be not despise by the normal his life be also colorful and delightful although we can be aware of the loneliness and the painful fetter through his eyes one important factor of christys success be his mother support which seem to be more touching and the unknown actress brenda fricker also deserve her oscar award for this role this fat little middleaged woman use her all to make christys dream come true so lucky for christy and hugh oconor be also excellent a young christy what a performance for a child the love story of christy be very welldone trustful christy want love and nothing can derive him of the right to love his crush on the beautiful dr  eileen cole surprisingly play by fiona shaw i be deeply impressed with her role in harry potter series the loathsome aunt petunia so her appearance in this role be really beyond my mind but anyway any woman have her own youth     be paranoiac and offensive i do have sympathy for him love be a twoedged sword happiness and agony be just next to each other btw jim sheridan work be all good in america the boxer etc except get rich or die try god know why he choose to direct that crap really a career taint for him what a pity  n  im stun that the reviewer imdb give this tv film a a high a rating a they do it an innocuous sweet uncomplicated clich   of a film that have two big name from the past in it both of whom do a decent job but this film reek of the low budget work we can see any day of week on the less cable channel i like a good romance as well a anyone but a my wife and i be watch thisand before we saw the ratingwe say there be people who be go to rate this film too highly simply because there nothing in it to challenge their ains their faith their comfort level or their cultural preference it possible to make a good film like that and away from her be an example but this be amateur hour there be some quite good film rat much low than this one truly another in a long line of woefully inadequate holiday film watch the family stone it mile ahead of this schlock  n  do a title search on randolph scott and trail street be the one film miss from the list youve see one of film scott make at rko during his prime the others be always easy to get liberal kansa be just southwest of dodge city and be a powderkeg about to explode between the trailriders who drive the longhorn into trail street the town main street and the sodbuster who fee our belly itll take a strong man like bat masterson to step between the two group and ing the town to order more i wont say except that scott movie usually have just one pretty girl and this one have three randolph scott always play men you could look up to for their sense of honor courage levelheadedness and willingness to do the right thing fifty year ago parent could send their kid to a scott movie with confidence theyd learn positive value robert ryan costars in this film play a good guy for a change in real life ryan be one of the many world war ii hero who star in america movie how sad what we get these day george clooney teach our young that we ought sympathize with suicide bomber while steven spielberg teach there be no moral difference between the olympic athlete murder in in munich and the palestinian terrorist who kill them hollywood derive their moral compass from too much cocaine and too much commitment to the wacky left i wonder how all this play out in liberal kansa liberal after all be not a dirty word year ago when the city be name  n  i go to see this one with much expectation quite unfortunately the dialogue be utterly stupid and overall the movie be far from inspire awe or interest even a child can see the miss logic to character behavior todays kid need creative story which would inspire them which would make them daydream about the event thats precisely what happen with movie like e t and star war a decade ago how many kid imagine about become jedi knight and ignite their own lightsabers seriously dont waste your time money on this one  n   sigh  leave it to u finns to take a stupid idea blow it out of proportion and try to market it a cool lordi be a mediocre band at best and a single gimmick will get you only so far to all you market idiot out there this be the reason for the inherent minority complex that be often encounter when finland try to export something lordi isnt scary lordi be lame lordi be over i want to apologize to the rest of the world for this plasticfaced idiocy sure they win the eurovision no wait they win the eurovision thats it i rest my case  n  after the high of darkplace it be never conceivable that holness and adobye would be able to create anything half as good a garth marengi yet i think that man to man in it own right be as good a show on the good episode a darkplace i cant argue that of the episode really arent that good but the other certainly make up for it if i have to pick great episode id go for formula driver steve pising pronounce pissing and the great garth marengi to already have a bit of understanding of the programme be a real plus a dean learner make many inside joke but even if you havent see much dean id recommend this a some of the rant he launch into be genius ie his argument with def lepord over their name all in all a great show which just miss full mark because of the couple of less funny episode  n  i saw this movie in a theater while on vacation in pablo co  i have just quit my biomedical engineering job at a hospital i consider the script to be a exaggeration of the real type of stuff that go on in hospital the idiot that put it down on production value dont get the point and probably have never be hospitalize and never work in one for sure billy jack same era be very poorly produce but have a significant social comment and be a very good movie with a real social message i have ever since be look for this movie this be the first site i have find where it get mention  n  i catch this on television one day when i be young and love it in the s there be a bunch of lame comedy that try too hard to be be funny so it this be a nice surprise it one of the best comedy of the s and the definitive summer camp comedy thanks to murrarys excellent comedic performance which still stand a one of his great this be the film that really get ivan reitman notice a a director reitman prove with this movie that he be one of the most talented comedy director of all time while this film be hilarious and meatball be so bad that it fun meatball and meatball be absolutely dreadful recommend for those who enjoy stripe and ghostbusters  n  the film design seem to be the alpha and omega of some of the major issue in this country u s  we see relationship all over at the university set for the film befittingly the obvious of student v s teacher be present but what the film add to it value be it other relationship male v s female white v s black and the individual v s society but most important of all and in direct relation to all of the other relationship be the individual v s himself i be amaze at how bilateral a point of view the director give to show the race relation on campus most film typically show the injustice of one side while show the suffering of the other this film show the injustice and suffering of both side it do not attempt to show how either be right although i would say the skin head be show a much crueler and vindictive quite obvious towards the end the film also discuss sex and rape it be ironically this injustice that in some way ings the two race together for a time lawrence fishburne do an overthetop performance a the sagacious profesor phipps he crumble the idea of race favortism and instead show the parallelism of the lazy and downtrodden with the industrious and positive other star that make this film be omar epps ice cube and jennifer connelly michael rapaport give an excellent portrayal of a confused youth with misplaced anger who be look for acceptance tyra bank make her film debut and prove supermodel can act higher learn get it name in show college a more than go to class and get a piece of paper in fact i would say the film be almost a satire in show student interaction with each other rather than some dry book a the real education at a university it be a lifelearning process not a textual one i think youll find high learning be apropos to the important issue at many university and even life in general  n  be rich ail elizabeth taylor court the angel of death on her island fortress in the mediterranean or be she just overreactingor more precisely overactingas usual actually both be applicable in director joseph loseys wander meander mess call boom appropriately title since temper in the lush luxurious set be nearly ready to explode richard burton climb taylor mountain uninvited she dress him in a samurais robe complete with saber though greatlooking in widescreen the picture be otherwise quite deadly a failure even liz n dickphiles should shun the star collective what the hell attitude to their lates film career reach an egomad nadir here pointless confused and maddening boom be a catastrophealthough screenwriter tennessee williams who adapt his own unsuccessful play the milk train doesnt stop here anymore be say to be quite fond of it from       n  i cant even describe it it the bad movie ive ever see im be a nice guy when i call it movie  just another bigbudgetmadetosomeonewhodoesntliketothinkmuch its not even scary it revolt when there be great movie that never reach the big screen and then come this     thing to trick movie fan i guess big producer make whatever they want just get a big producer hot chick allthough horrible actress and a ton of horror movie clich  s and cook it for a week or so and youll get the nun and i think bad boy be horrible  n  the screenplay be the bad part of this film a it lurch from one premise to the next miss all the important bit that would have make a number of different story possible this film be confuse because the audience doesnt know what the story be i have no problem with the lowproduction value and the act wasnt great but this be telly so it be fine i dont mind if some scene look like they be do in one take but have such a nonsensical screenplay be completely unnecessary do any executive actually read it before fork out the cash avoid this at all costs the prologue in particular be so poorly write it need a voiceover to fill in all the detail that have be leave out the prologue be rush it wasnt clear what be happen ie the russian revolution be reduce to some riot be happen in petersburg with the next scene be soldier arrest them i know the basic history of the revolution so i could fill in the detail those pesky communists the prologue be best ignored this could have be a thoughtful study of a person who be confuse about who she be it set up this premise in the asylum it could then have her struggle to identify herself for the rest of the film no go the film assume she be who she say she be even though there be still no empirical evidence it set up a melodramatic romance a love so strong itll believe anything she say okay a soppy romance no because it make no sense the love interest seem like a crazed and incidentally sleazy lunatic burst out in wild gesture this also doesnt work because the film stupidly decide to tell the truth in the monologue at the end they never get married and she return to america the love story collapse despite there be plenty of love scene i be never convince of the reason that they be in love i find romcom romance more convincing despite there only be one or two scene which establish that theyve even spend any time with each other it could have be a thrillertype thing where the film assume she be who she say she be and she struggle to prove her identity no the court case be sum up rather than deal with the bizarre voice over come back again to fill in the detail of a good film the funny thing to consider be what really happen anna anderson be a loony who go to america and marry another loony and they do crazy thing together throughout her life she have bout of lunatic behaviour none of this in the film either theres a really annoying character in the asylum who crop up from nowhere and announce herself a a one flew over the cuckoos next twelve monkeystype informant thankfully she vanish have ought nothing to the story  n  lady and the tramp ii scamps adventure i think be a good movie but i think the first lady and the tramp movie be well because it be the original and i would think that the original movie compare to the sequeals be good lady and the tramp ii take off after the original but this time it junior turn lady and tramps youngster scamp always hat be treat with the thing that have to be do with him follow the rule in the house take bath all the time and take thing nice and easy scamp get angry and run away with a pack of dog that be leave off the loose scamp meet another dog call angel they both get along fine and do the thing scamp mother and father do have an italian meal spagetthi and meatball etc afterwards scamp realise that he be love by his family especial his pal which be the baby scamp come back and angel be join in the family i give this movie out of  n  wow whats this on the video rental store shelf in front of me nothing other than a questionable sequel to mm it wasnt a very good sequel to a movie that have a very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far great than this movie basically from the plot outline verbatim an american diplomat david huxley and his fianc  e tish harrington venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in budapest hungary to find out who be blackmail them with a porno video take of them with a prostitute risa the entire story be base around the various character who make up these various sex club and strip joint throughout the city the mystery be solve when in the end tish find out that the ransom money for the video and essentially later on in the story her fianc  e which come out of her trust fund money be basically go back to her future husband a the story unfold til the bitter end i didnt like how this have nothing to do with the original mm at all the only thing close to the original be the type of thriller that it be the fact that david end up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner look like the kinky world of the first film and the fact that the entire movie have sex emblazon throughout almost every key scene otherwise it a totally different movie it make for a lousy love story even before the end be know which make the end more of a possibility because i didnt believe the word come out of david mouth the whole time but we be warn that he be a liar about most thing that might get him in trouble there be ridiculous nude scene in most of the shock moment of the film which be try to stir emotion in the audience to cheer for tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this hellish sex debauchery i count at least ridiculously film sequence when there be nothing but sex to be show even the menu screen on the dvd be nothing but film with naked woman on it to make the dvd seem totally provocative david be no heroic person throughout the film you could guess he be the main problem long before the end the actor who play each role be all new to me which might explain how they get so many of them to strip down to gain act respect there be plot hole how do david and richard finally impress tishs father by get the lease they want when david be so wrap up in this damn investigation to try and find a prostitute there be cheesy technology moment like the talk email program dress up like a bondage queen and a gay other character which do nothing but show how the director be try to get a joaquin phoenix knockoff to play this character the tag line feature on this profile for this video be complete bs too because it wasnt even about a last eath nobody really die but they do have a good car crash sequence that come out of nowhere     but that be a good second long out of an hour and long movie go rent and maybe buy the original it one of joel schumachers well and more original film it have everything well about it from this film i wouldnt recommend see this unless you want to compare apple to orange  n  ok honestly i dont see why everybody think this be so great it really not there be two good thing that come out of this movie jack performance he be very good i can tip my hat for him dannys performance he be good no other then that it get pretty stupid and what be stanley kuick think draft shelly a the wendy she be so bad she look the same every time she get scar the problem with this movie be the end i would have have more respect for it if kuick would have end it differently and the over all movie be just stupid the problem with the movie be that the book be so much good so dont see the movie read the book and you will be much good off  n  this episode have potential the basic premise of a woman live next door to an empty apartment but a phone that constantly ring be somewhat interesting and when she explore the noise there be genuine tension and fear but stupid script write ruin any promise the episode had first of all the woman readily admit to see thing that would send most of u run in the other direction e g it funny that the door slam shut even though there be no wind this door have serious damage to it that wasnt here a minute ago the door open by itself without me touch it etc     give these supernatural phenomenon plus the fact that a woman commit suicide in the room wouldnt she take some precaution before enter it maybe she could investigate in the day time or maybe she could investigate the apartment with somebody else or maybe she could turn on the light also while in the haunted apartment she decide to make numerous phone call to the operator and get into an argument over who have the power to disconnect the phone and then they begin discuss the detail of the suicide just unplug the phone the phone company doesnt need to be involve walk up to the phone and unplug it case closed finally show the phone scamper across the floor like it alive be just comical if the director want the woman to get strangle by the phone card he couldve do it in a way that didnt look cartoony brave little toaster anyone  n  the quality of this movie be simply unmatched by any baseball title of it time pam dixon anches out in the film industry to recruit bluechip prospect and make this work of art a mustsee academy award winner brenda fricker home alone lose in new york a time to kill ben johnson the last picture show red dawn and adrien brody the pianist the village amplify the atmosphere of the movie drawing in an anxious audience however the dramatic performance be neutralize by quirky radio oadcaster jay o  sander jfk the day after tomorrow  the story be centralize around a foster child upandcoming actor joseph gordonlevitt brick the lookout sidekick milton davis jr  deliver a tearjerking performance a the longtime friend who never know his parent the two dont have much but what they do have angel baseball and what they be seek identity thats when time emmy nominee danny glover lethal weapon predator come in to save the day a frustrated angel manager george knox in relation all character in the story seem to have the same mission search within themselves to find out who they really are depressed over the fact that roger jgl be separate from his father he wish to god for reunification if the angel can take the pennant odds be astronomical but time emmy winner christopher lloyd back to the future my favorite martian come in a the omniscient overseer to work a little magic pun before you know it al lloyd be sit with roger in the stand snack on cracker jack and cause some of baseball big boner dorothy kingsley and george well dk oscar nominee gw oscar winner screenplay be do justice under the finger of mastermind william dear nominate in director guild of america he include a touching side story center around pitcher mel clark play by tony danza time golden globe nominee emmy nominee who in relation to all other cast member be just try to find his place in a confused anaheim clark have be dub a washup a once bigname in cinci but he have something to prove to manager knox spoiling this nailbiting plot would simply be the equivalent to commit adultery in the th century this one be a diamond in the rough and it will keep you on the edge of the seat until all come to peace do i mention a cameo by matthew mcconaughey a time to kill we be marshall for all you ladies out there  n  i keep watch it because it seem like the plot be go somewhere when it ambiguously get there i be very disappointed im go to tell you what really happen in the next sentence but maybe i wont maybe ill just imply something will happen the writer lack any imagination this be not even a b movie it a make for tv b movie  n  the movie itself make me want to go and call someone so they could enjoy it too it be extremely funny angelena jolie be wonderful a juliet the parent be hilarious they be caterer as well a enemies the kid play the part of romeo and juliet in the church play they fall in love and their parent try to keep them apart spoiler ahead i think they sneak off after a party and do it surprisingly they still want to get marry in the end of the movie if you dont like stereotype and the defilement of classic literature dont watch if you dont mind those you will have a blast watching this one  n  if somebody want to make a really really bad movie wizard of the lost kingdom really set a yardstick by which to measure the depth of badness start with the pseudochewbacca that follow around the main character     some poor schmuck in a baggy white furry costume that look a if it be stitch together from discard piece of carpet work your way slowly painfully through more notsospecial effect that thoroughly deny the viewer from suspension of disbelief add a garden gnome just for the heck of it  on second think skip this movie entirely and find something else to do for an hour and a half  n  a film for mature educate audience     i saw random heart in an advance screen shortly before it north american release this romantic drama be quite a treat im sure this story will not be everyones cup of tea especially consider the film darkly downbeat premise but the pic have some very uplifting strong point in it favor alltime box office draw harrison ford star war raider of the lose ark the fugitive air force one patriot game be at the top of his game a the harried and desperate internal affair officer dutch ford very subdue nuanced performance show quite the range he can achieve with class and determination in inging the audience into his world of loss betrayal this be the perfect complex role and very different type of film for harrison ford to grace the screen with between his action blockbuster next year harrison ford return to action first for director robert zemeckis forrest gump back to the future in his summer thriller what lie beneath and reportedly later in the year in the film adaptation of tom clancys the sum of all fear fear will be harrison ford third out a cia operative jack ryan director sydney pollack out of africa the firm tootsie have a support role in this feature a a political advisor to scottthomas congresswoman it a very sharp energetic portrayal for pollack not only be sydney pollack a gifted director he be also one of the most believable natural and charming actor around see eye wide shut a well  kristin scottthomas the english patient the horse whisperer show that you dont necessarily have to be eccentric or worldly to be consider sexy this be one of her good film and she give a tremendously craft and mellow performance that work well opposite ford quietman toughness the subplots work wonderfully especially the subplot involve ford character investigation into police corruption look for a chill effective turn by heat actor dennis haysbert who play detective george beaufort the obstacle to overcome in dutchs investigation into police corruption the rest of the support cast be a wonderful delight charles s  dutton whose long overdue for a film lead role go to show that he be one of the best characteractors around and bonnie hunt who i find extremely solid in this production steal most of her scene with that wonderful charm smile a wendy judd the technical side of pollack thriller be top notch from dave grusins pollacks the firm perfectly surrealfeeling jazzy score to philippe rousselot a river run through it crisp photography to the sharp editing that keep the film feel fresh despite the film unfortunate downer premise i highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoy a good yarn of mystery wellpaced plot characterdriven story and romance all roll into one this be a terrific story about betrayal forgiveness it also feature one of the most surprising yet poignant and certain to be controversial ending for a harrison ford film in recent time random heart be definitely one of the good film of the year      out of      or out of  n  for all of the hasbeens or never wa or for the curious this film be for you      ever play a sport or wonder what it felt like after the light go down and the crowd left  this film explore that and more robin williams jack dundee be a small town assistant banker in taft ca whose

robin and russell be magic and who be kid lester holly palance and pamela reed give memorable performance a the wife of williams and russell succeed on many level a  n  this movie have to be one of the most boring and stupid movie that perrugorria have do it look like a commercial from begin to end the   director  spent the whole time on a tripod it doesnt have pace rhythm it illogical what a mess you can tell whats gon na happen since the first minute and the end     wowspoilerjesus christ how the hell perrugorria get shot be you serious bad scene of someone get shot ever end of spoilerbad direct bad script bad acting     really bad overall i wouldnt recommend this movie at all it a waste of money and time  n  i first remember bump into this zaniness from the zucker others and jim aahams back in the early day at comedy central back in those day the s their programming consist of benny hill rerun and the original mstk complete with bearded host capt frank drebin play by the stonefaced deadpan filibuster leslie nielson be a process create first from the amalgamation of various stereotypical police television show protagonists think dragnet meet starsky hutch the show boil in a flask full of wellknown police television show plot and scenario this be distil time to produce the most pure policeman every make forget about simon pegg in hot fuzz for now save it for later frank drebin be clueless at most time a terrible driver a terrible shot macho yet sensitive and vulnerable he be a master of the police investigative methodology a k a ask johnny the leathery old shoeshine boy this do not make him a bad cop cop get lucky also capt drebin notice hes a captain here have perfect it along with his partner nordberg and the rest of force perfectly parody the police drama over the course of golden episodes the show be a treasure trove of hilarious dialog and quotable quoteables most of the sight gag be a bit dated and silly the magic never come from the sight gagshowever at it core be a nonsensical and straightfaced conversation and activity in the foreground with crazy thing occur in the background the movie can best be describe a minute compilation of the best gag from this series think of monty python and now for something completely different       if you like airplane naked gun or top secret then you will definitely enjoy this i always like the series well than the movie even though i saw the movie first why word no o j  n  a guy desperate for action attempt to hit on a gorgeous girl in a bus she refuse him but when he run after someone who try to steal her purse they get together anyway and there it start a relation that be slightly taint by the fact that she be a jealous and neurotic superhero it cant be a secret that thing between them be go to be problematic in short a story that could promise to grow out into a cool film and imo it succeed at be a nice film it no masterpiece but it have me in tear from laugh on more than one occasion the two lead character twirl around each other in a crazy love fest that be even with the superhero thing go believable so thin story but work out really funny and thus worthy of cinema time out of oken heart  n  i think it be great one of my favourite film a a kid and who say there song be unforgettable they be mint i can still remember them now word for word the film remain a favourite with my family and my young cousin be now addict to it too they even know the song this film be great and a enjoyable film for kid it have a moral lesson so dont say it not good because it show how lying get you nowhere ill leave with a parting comment this film be amaze love me xxx p s i would like the soundtrack but i cant and yes the animation be good the joke be humorous and the action never stops this film will go down in childrens film history and in my opinion one of the only remain safe film to show child  n  the film someone have to make waco the rule of engagement dissect the evidence behind the standoff in waco texas that lead to the destruction of the branch davidian homestead and the alleged government coverup the first thing you need to know about this film you will see ief but disturb photo of the victim body this be not do for shock value but to illustrate point about the way they die a if you be present at the coroner inquest the second thing you should know about this film at two and a quarter hour it pretty ponderous especially if you already follow the event closely at the time if you be unaware of any of the event other than what be report in the mass medium or if the only side of the story you be familiar with be the official government report this may be essential view if on the other hand you want a more concise albeit unapologetically one side version of event you should see waco the big lie in summary this be pretty much the definitive documentary about this tragic event and be very sobering but a a work of filmmaking could test your patience especially if you have a short attention span and it at time superfluous for those who watch the cspan hearing and the minute reports perhaps someday someone will make a documentary that cover some of the stranger aspect of this story such a the bizarre chain of event that lead up to the atf raid or the psychological warfare tactic the fbi use blast rock music at the sect and their charismatic leader all rock musician themselves pick up their instrument and turn their massive amplifier outward to blast their own music right back at them  n  what a good movie at last a picture reveal a unknown side of rock illusion of fame wellknown rocker be get old and forget not the music and with a good sense of humour have you ever dance on bill haley rock around the clock anyway still crazy be probably the best movie about rock nroll i have ever see far much good than spinal tap for instance why because in still crazy people be mature they have a different point of view about rock about love and about life they want to catch up with their crazy youth they miss so much beyond the story itself we see character with their own personality weakness and dream like anyone of us spend a good time watch this listen to the awesome soundtrack and finally think of your own future bye  n  have it with the one who raise you since when you be young you just want her go from your life that woman be your mother you should respect her you should honor her whether shes in sick or well but that in time it can be aggravate especially when she become very overbearing thats how owen danny devito have to deal with in throw momma fron the train his momma anne ramsey be one of the bad he try his best to be a writer and she be everything but grateful call him a clumsy poop a larda and fat and stupid for his friend larry donner billy crystal he have his own woman problem his exwife she try to discredit him so what do owen do push her overboard what do he do help return the favor get rid of mrs  lift in the kitchen scene i like it where owen call larry cousin patty and momma say you dont have a cousin patty and owen shout you lie to me and el cabongs larry with the fry pan then come the fun part when they where on the train and try to kill momma lift that be thwart and she kick larry off the train well everything back to normal the exwife live but momma kick the bucket on her own maybe she should have see the error of her domineering way a fun movie it be and the cast be great a classic star  n  yes it be a bit cheesy but it suspenseful and entertaining and one of my favorite there be some excellent actor in the film and they do a commendable job give the limitation of plot and character it interesting to see david soul in a bad guy role i think he be quite believableand rather chillingas the evermoreparanoid co  robert conrad be a longtime favoritei think he ings his character to life very well and sam waterston have be star quality in everything of his ive watchedmovies or tv i watch this movie every so often but our tape a vhs tv copy i get be such poor quality it difficult to fully enjoy it this be a movie i think they should put out on dvd maybe it wouldnt be universally seek after but im sure there be lot of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there would be a market for a dvd version ill keep hoping  n  so it isnt an epic but for people experience anything similar sibling suicide it might be an interesting way of therapy animaginative narrative and some fine acting make it time wellspent for some reason it hasnt really catch on in the audiencesomething i do believe be a result of the main theme why do shecommit suicide clearly this be hardly something that usmoviegoers will flock to have it be an european production itprobably would have reach it audience in a much greaterextent it be however a movie that although the realism taint by ashimmering romanticize glow give the viewer a whole heartedimpression  n  i absolutely love this film i be hesitant to watch it at first because i think it would be too painful i remember how hard it be when john be shoot however watch the two of u take me back to a happy time when he be still alive and there be hope and possibility i think that the writer do an amazing job depict what might have be aidan quinn be adorable a paul and meet the challenge head on i be impress with his accent and mannerism jar harris be also very talented and be quite believable a john my favorite part be the scene in the park and the rooftop scene which be so poignant the film leave me with both sadness and satisfaction both of which i feel be appropriate give the circumstance  n  previous reviewer claudio carvalho give a much good recap of the film plot detail than i could what i recall mostly be that it be just so beautiful in every sense emotionally visually editorially just gorgeous if you like movie that be wonderful to look at and also have emotional content to which that beauty be relevant i think you will be glad to have see this extraordinary and unusual work of art on a scale of to id give it about an    the only reason i shy away from be that it be a mood piece if you be in the mood for a really artistic very romantic film then it a i definitely think it a mustsee but none of u can be in that mood all the time so overall     n  great premise poor execution cast of great actor be watered down into a poorly write poorly direct poorly edit waste of film only redeem quality be the numerous shot of the food joan chen mercedes ruehl kyra sedgwick and alfre woodard should fire their agent  n  have to agree that this movie and it talented director do not receive the plaudit they deserve here hop that the dvd will do very well and ing both to the attention of a wider audience the actor give excellent performance and the plot be excellent perhaps overall the movie be a little long but may mile thomas seem to enjoy her actor when they be give strong performance and therefore sometimes hold them in long close ups than necessary good for the actor i be sure but sometimes a the audience you be ready to move on so to speak with the plot may mile thomas deserves more recognition from the film business a one of our foremost digital movie director  n  i have two reason for watch this swashbuckler when it air on danish television yesterday first of all i want to see gina lolloigida and here i wasnt disappointed she look gorgeous second of all through read about the film i have get the impression that it feature absurd humor not unlike that which can be find in philippe de broca film on this account however i be sadly disappointed i find the joke predictable apart from a few witty remark on the topic of war and the character completely onedimensional also the action scene be do in a strangely mechanical and uninspired fashion with no sense of drama at all i keep watch until the end but i get bored very quickly and just sit there wait for the scene with lolloigida  n  this film be an abomination of all that be worthy in film make the lead actor surprise his audience by not actually act at all we have to watch almost two hour of his bland soulless face the joke be all lame i never laugh once it be saturday night there be of u have a beer all up for a laugh and then we put this on and you could feel all the warmth and colour be drain from the room the film end and the mood be ruin so we all go our separate way ruin the night ok so pros and con pro beautiful set in hawaii look good on bluray con worst act ever you can tell everyone concern be just think about payday predictable poor plot zero character development force joke which fall flat many shot of the guy penis which to be fair act well than him and have more charisma may all maker of this film hang their head in shame and hold their flaccid manhood cheap  n  this be my first gaspar noe movie ive watch and i have to say i be shock i dont mind gore in generally but this isnt even gore it real butchering for some of you a couple of scene may be impossible to see and i mean really disgust leave aside these aspect the main idea reveal here and the dialog be quite illiant when you be give a strong argument against inging a new life into the world and the manner in which it be give you cant stop and take a minute to think about it the actor do their job well represent general mask of a handpick few people find at the bottom of a diseased society the movie be full of metaphor but ill let you figure them out dont watch it if you want to have a lite relaxing time i recommend this movie to all those of you who want something to think about or simply watch something different of what you find in your average cinema  n  i agree with bigalc this movie actually prepare me for a lot of the cultural difference and practice before i go to live in japan for a year in tom selleck do a fantastic job here a always and the movie be greatly humorous and educational im a big fan of tom sellecks and he bless this part with his usual charm and charisma to this part inging the film to life in a way i cant imagine any other actor be able to pull off this film feature some firstrate japanese actor and it be highly entertaining to watch them a they interact with selleck i can imagine the fun he have during the actual filming of the movie japan an awesome place to go whether you want to party sightsee or just try to take everything in  n  i laugh so hard during this movie my face hurt ben affleck be hilarious and remind me of a pretty boy jack black in this role gandolfini give his typical a performance the entire cast be funny the story pretty good and the comic moment awesome i go into this movie not expect much so perhaps that be why i be so surprised to come out of the flick thoroughly pleased and facially exhaust i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoy comedy can identify with loneliness during the holiday and or put up with the relative the best part to this film to me anyway be the subtle bit of humor that catch me completely off guard and have me laugh long after the rest of the audience have stop namely the scene involve the lighting of the christmas tree go see it and have a good laugh  n  although i live in australia in i move overseas not long after feed up with constant industrial unrest the general worship of mediocrity unless one be a sportsman and the complacency of so many australian who choose to ignore the eakneck pace of change take place in country to their north consequently i miss the dismissal along with many other australianmade tv drama of the s and s such a the superb janus and phoenix series which i have since see along with wildside to me the filmed story of the dismissal be fair and as far a i be aware accurate however a to public outrage it only show one side of the picture not how family be rive by the controversy i know a my two others would not speak to me for month afterward but the commentary be in my view very onesided throughout the inescapable fact be that notwithstanding fiery expression of rage from a substantial proportion of the community the australian electorate chose and choose decisively in favour of fraser a they do again two year later this apart a historically accurate and superbly well acted docudrama  n  i may be a good old boy from virginia in the confederate state of america but this man do it for me that mustache get me rile up i remember when i first saw a video of his that girl he beat be amaze the depth of his act when they cut to his weathered facade be a new level of masculinity it remind me of the granite sculpture of our mt rushmore if i could ask him one question it would beif you be a hotdog would you eat yourself will orhan be do a reunion tour take note from the great like gordon lightfoot true music from the heart never fade away vive la john denver gracias my friend o f f l orhan fan for life  n  i never want to see this movie again not only be it dreadfully bad but i cant stand see my hero stan laurel look so old and sick mostly i cant stand watch this terrible movie frankly there be no reason to watch this awful film the plot be just plain stupid the actor that surround stan laurel and oliver hardy be really really bad and laurel and hardy have be funnier in any of their early film i warn you dont watch it the image will haunt you for a long while to come  n  the problem be the role of the character in the film man to man show a british anthropologist kidnap two pygmy and take them to scotland and then realise that they be not animal or subhumans but actually equal to himself the problem be the role of the pygmy in the film two people who be kidnap treat like animal and yet give such a shallow stereotypical role within the film     the kidnapper itish anthropologist end up be the hero of the film because he manage to relate to the pygmy     no notion of how the two hostage feel of their point of view of their ordeal     i find it be a shallow film with a one side fundamentally racist view     it never manage to move away from the white man view  n  life begin and end in a typical s maternity recovery ward where we view hour in the life of several high risk pregnant woman play by loretta young glenda farrell clara blandick aunty em vivienne osborne dorothy tree and gloria shea a they await to give birth while the film feature plot device which seem far fetch today when maternity ward be much more controlled and restrict it do offer u a look back in time to see what give birth in a typical city hospital in be like for our grandmother and greatgrandmothers i find the film fascinating and exceptionally moving oddly enough the most outstanding performance in this film come from a male cast member young eric linden a jed sutton grace loretta young husband what an actor a a first time father jed be distraught and uneasy with hospital staff who seem to ush off his concern about his wife a they might ush crumb off a cafeteria table i felt his every concern keenly id like to see more of this actor work he have a very emotional voice which be use to unforgettable effect in go with the wind in that film eric play the young soldier whose leg be amputate without anesthesia who scream dont cut dont cut a scarlett flee the hospital in horror chill another great performance be from aline macmahon who play miss bower the nurse her character be a salt of the earth type the kind of nurse we all hope to get for our hospital stay who eaks the hospital rule constantly in order to show a more humane side of the medical profession loretta young do another superb act job here as well a very authentic and deeply felt performance a grace my she be great in these precodes ive really grow to appreciate her more a an actress the last few months glenda farrell play her role of a shrill unwed mother a little over the top for my taste didnt anyone know back in that swig andy from a hot water bottle might be hazardous to unborn baby health but her character redeem herself in the end also in the cast be an uncredited gilbert roland silent movie star a a grieving italian husband his screen time be ief but notable life begin be a mustsee precode try to catch it sometime on tcm but remember to ing a few hanky to cry into out of  n  this be a great film touching and strong the direction be without question eathless good work to the team i feel so sorry for marlene by the grace of god go you or i  n  i think the manuscript of this movie be write on the piece of toiletpaper no respect whatsoever to many important detail which intrinsically make the movie for example the name of some serbian terrorist that i remember be caradan maldic ivanic loyvek and leo hasse what kind of name be that certainly not serbian by the way caradan maldic what a name i laugh for day think about it probably an implication on karadzic and mladic secondly there have never be any case of terrorism do by serbian a journalist like the main character ought to have know that thirdly the actor play serbian terrorist be not even serbs nor do they speak serbocroatian all this aside this movie be solidly act but the story be paperthin and full of hole at time it make no sense whatsoever  n   criticism do mention spoilers i rarely make user comment but this be one movie i have no problem slander this movie stink and it mediocre of rating of and a half star be probably too high for such pulp the bone collector be not at all the same calie of film that silence of the lamb or seven be despite what it ad claim this be a perfect example of how not to make a thriller the pace of this movie be extremely slow i actually leave for about minute halfway through and come back at the exact scene with the exact same character with absolutely no progression i refer to you the part where angelina jolies character debate denzel about cut off a corpse hand the movie be not at all scary but try to compensate this with a lovesubplot albeit sexy angelina jolies character and denzel washington of course what you get be something comparable to that of the mentorstudent relationship a see in the illian epic silence of the lamb with hannibal lecter and starling however even this lack all effectiveness and i be personally rout for the villain to kill denzel off so a to avoid hackneyed giggle between the two with such a crappy movie i be halfexpecting a plottwist or some sort of spectacular situation to occur at the end to give the movie some credit thing that mediocre movie like arlington road and scream pull off anybody with a th grade education can see the end how will be resolve a situation which mimicks alfred hitchcock rear window the cliche of have the killer explain his motif be uninspired enough but the reason be so ridiculous and stupid it have me spew latte over the screen esoterically speak i even think the murderer intention be completely lose a denzel happily recovers from his loss over the proverbial chess game and get with his pet project angelina if you be a fan of movie with original idea and genuinely dynamic concept like i be you will not appreciate this film if you have not attend a single movie in your life and would like to catchup on every single hollywood cliche ever bear the latenight knock on the window from somebody else but the murderer the ridiculous serialkiller to prime investigator relationship the horrible woman try to get by in an allmale dominate workforce aka sotl see this movie      but even then it too slowpaced and youd be bore  n  possible spoiler perhaps i must say that cinderella ii dream come true be one of the bad movie ever make first of all the movie be make during the height of disney sequel rampage it be create around the same time a the little mermaid ii the jungle book ii and peter pan ii all of which be disservice to their original film classic disney also make the hunchback of notre dame ii and atlantis ii but im go to drop that topic because their original movie be never really classic in the first place let me go ahead and say that i be an avid supporter of good disney film and i absolutely adore the original disney cinderella the sequel to cinderella however be a waste of time the character of cinderella in the sequel be so very unlike the original girl that i grow up watch in the original cinderella be kind and love the new cinderella have very outofcharacter moment with currentera phrase like im go to do this banquet my way let me also tell you that new cinderella a i have affectionately name her say ewww that be the anticinderella i try to find the best in people but in the sequel anastasia one of the stepsister be good what the heck why they make it all out to be like lady tremaine and drizella be just horrible family member for poor little anastasia my question to the world do the people at disney watch the original cinderella when make this sequel well it surely doesnt seem so if i remember correctly anastasia be just as abusive to cinderella a drizella and lady tremaine i be all for redemption and forgiveness but there be no point of redemption for anastasia in this movie in the first one anastasia be evil in the second one she be good one just cant leave a story like this i hope disney realize that this movie among other movie be sham walt disney name perhaps now that michael eisner be go thing will start shape up around the house of mouse  n  hopefully the score have change by now due to my illiant and stun review which persuade all of you to go and watch the film thereby create an instant chorus of s this movie true score as mention before chris rock be the king previous to go to see this movie i wasnt that over the top about him but now im bang on the door of chris rock website beg him to take me on a his protege this film be truly funny if you dont find this movie funny you really need therapy and it humour which target all area of society include race predictably class division love wealth employment dream stand up comedy     the list go on there be one slight disappointment for me however this be that in go into this film i didnt realise that it be actually a remake of heaven can wait another quite good movie make in with warren beatty a such i be quite surprised when i watch this movie and suddenly the plot begin to unravel to be distinctly similar to an old movie i have watch on tv a few week ago   regardless this movie be in my opinion the good version out of the two of them simply because of the different area it cover and the fact that chris rock be funny than warren beatty any second of any day of any week of any year of any     you get the picture well to the actual plot of the film dont spoil the experience for yourself dont read the plot just go and watch a movie because there have be two review on imdb so far that have rave mad about it go see it because it be the funny thing you would have see in a long time go and see it because it a cinema experience that doesnt leave you grumble ad nauseum at the cost of cinema ticket go see it because it be a good movie  n  formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich chilenian who stand to inherit a fortune and get mixed up in the affair of bad guy and fall in love with a beautiful female lawyer vargas it look very much like a tv movie not really excite the only reason i bother to see it be because valentina vargas be in it no real surprise here though it be nice to see vargas great look chilenian landscape on display but malcolm mcdowells part be very small and doesnt add much to the movie michael ironside play a usual a bad guy but this be not one of his most memorable part the chase scene be standard fare  n  whatever rating i give boom be only because of the superb location photography of sardinia and rome otherwise this be only for hardcore addict of elizabeth taylor her downward phase and richard burton his miscast phase tennessee williams write the milk train doesnt stop here anymore and be suppose to be very fond of this adaptation of his playbut apparently he be the only one taylor reportedly hat it and burton need the money whatever it amount to a hill of bean with taylor posturing and fuming in her shrill manner explode at the servant and exchange bad babytalk with no less than noel coward who seem to be a visitor from another film when he finally appears its so campy that among taylor fan it probably consider a must see kind of thing but if you can sit through this one without a drink in your hand youre way ahead of me sadly this be the film that signify the end of taylor be take seriously a a film actress even after win two oscar for burton it be equally disastrous and the critic call it a bomb judge for yourself if you dare  n  viva la bam this jackass spin off focus on the obviously scripted adventure of bam margera and his pal johnny knoxville brandon dicamillo etc this show while it have it fair share of grossout comedy and crazy stunt focus mainly on bam torture of his parents im sorry to say this bam but     youre in no way as cool a you think you be this ego trip show be not only painfully unfunny and yes i like jackass but also narcissistic beyond belief the overly stylize intro end with bam coolly explain that hes go to do whatever the f    he want to how about you do something that be actually funny i like jackass for what it be worth the camerawork be horrible any idiot could have make a good show with a camcorder in their parent garage but at least the show move at a steady pace and never felt bore between the crazy dangerous or simply disgust stunt the pal performed not so with viva la bam we follow our hero around a he play prank on his friend and torture his relative but never do it feel like anything else than really lame and scripted comedy the stunt and prank be mildly entertaining but present in such a tedious and dull fashion that they can barely make you smile viva la bam be a poor spinoff of that do little good but feed margeras already too big ego i dont recommend this lame and unimaginative show to anyone  n  i have never hear of larry fessenden before but judge by this effort into write and direct he should keep his day job a a journeyman actor like many others on here i dont know how to categorize this film it wasnt scary or spooky so cant be call a horror the plot be so wafer thin it cant be a drama there be no suspense so it cant be a thriller it just a bad film that you should only see if you be a fan of the blair witch project people who like this film use word like ambiguity and complex and subtle but they be read into something that wasnt there like the blair witch people get scared because people assume they should be scar and buy into some guff that it be terrify this movie actually start off well with the family meet the local after hit a deer it look like be a modern day deliverance but then for the next minute well over half the film nothing happen the family pot about their holiday home which be all very nice and dandy but not the slight bit entertain it be obvious the local would be involve in some way at some stage but essendon clearly have no idea how to build suspense in a movie finally when something do happen it not even clear how the father be shot how he die the nurse say his liver be only grazed and all the time this wendigo spirit apparently track down the apparent shooter in a very clumsy way with rd grade special effect the film be call wendigo but no attempt be make to explain it in any clear way the film end all muddle and leave you very unsatisfied i would have bail out with minute to go but i want to see if this movie could redeem itself it didnt  n  schlocky s horror film     ya get ta love em in contrast to todays bore slasher flick these ktel special actually do something scary and do not resort to a tire formula this be a b movie about the making of a b movie     that go horribly wrong faith domergue this island earth star a an overthehill b movie queen make a movie about a series of grisly murder that befall a family in their home her boyfriend director who look and act like gordon jump with an attitude be film on location and on a tight schedule the ken doll costar discover a book of tibetian chant that they work into the script to add realism unfortunately realism be something they could have do without john carradine have long since give up look for the th gland the unearthly now eeks out a humble existence a the caretaker for the estate he go about his daily work but always seem to run afoul of the director the horror build slowly a dead cat here john carradine enter a grave there finally culminate in seven yes seven murder at least there truth in advertising it just sad that the ghoul didnt understand that there be a movie be make above him how be poor faith to know that those darn tibetian chant would actually work face it you just cant go around tug on satan coat and expect him to take it lie down sterno say perform an autopsy on the house of seven corps  n  i suppose for this film be suppose to be cool but look back now year it charm be just as silly a it entertainment value grant the special effect do well on t v with the series that start in but for the big screen i once have a fish tank that be equally a excite i must agree about the octopus scene near the end where it attach itself to the seaview obviously not well stag     or trained overall it pretty bad act with shoddy special effect and i still do recommend it for fun laugh sake this be probably one of irwin allen big film and i think he think a lot of it barabara eden go on to play genie on t v micheal ansara be her husband now that be a cool part about this film i always enjoy see real life husband and wife team star in the same movie neat  n  this be one of the fine film to come out of hong kongs new wave that begin with tsui harks zu warrior of magic mountain tsui set a tone for the new wave approach to the martial art film that pretty much all the director of the new wave jackie chan sammo hung wong jing ching siu tung etc accept from then on a a give namely the approach to such film thenceforth would need more than a touch of irony if not outright comedy burn paradise put a stop to all that and with a vengeance its not that there isnt humor here but it be a purely human humor a with the aged buddhist priest at the beginning who somehow manage a quick feel of the nubile young prostitute while hide in a bundle of straw but this be just a human be not even buddhist priest can be saint all the time when irony be at last introduce into the film it be the nasty possible emanate from the abbot of red lotus temple who be a study in pure nihilism such a have never be record on film before he be the very incarnation of milton satan from paradise lose well to rule in hell than serve in heaven and if he cant get to satan hell soon enough hell turn the world around him into a living hell he can rule thats the motif underscore the utal violence of much of the imagery here it not that the abbot just want to kill people he want them to despair to feel utterly hopeless to accept his nihilism a allencompassing reality thus theres a definite sense pervade the red temple scene that there just might not be any other reality outside of the temple itself it have become all there be to the universe and the abbot claim mastery of infinite power be in charge of course fortunately the film doesnt end there though there be loss the human will to be just ordinarily human at last prevails if you want to know how see the film yet there be no doubt that in view this film we visit hell hopefully we do not witness our own afterlives but we certainly feel chasten by the experience and somehow well for it over all  n  now i dont hate cheap movie i just dont see why you should waste any money for a movie you could shoot with your dad camcorder if i rent a movie i want it to be a movie not a bunch of people think it would be a good idea to waste some minidv tapes maybe i hate this one so much because the guy in the video store say it be great and it wasnt maybe i hate it because it cheap have the dumbest plot ever the most unrealistic character ever and the really really really bad showdown in the history of film ever even tom savini cant save this seriously this one be a complete waste of time  n  a fabulous book about a fox and his family who do what fox do that be steal from farm and kill prey until a trio of farmer decide theyve have enough of this fox and try in various way to have the problem solve they be of course out fox at every turn and while the trio be camp out at the fox hole the family perform raid against the three farmer land thefilm version and i use the term film very loosely be more of a god awful pastiche of american heist movie particularly the ocean movie they they even have george clooney a mr fox to to add to the insult and manage to miss the point of the story quite completely so kudos to them  theyll make lot of money and destroy another classic roald dahl child book  n  as soon a it hit a screen it destroy all intelligent life form around but on behalf of it producer i must say it doesnt fall into any know movie category it deserve a and new denomination of it own it a neurological drama it sadden and depress every single neuron inside a person ain its the close thing one will ever get to a stroke without actually suffer one it drive you speechless all you member go numb your mouth fall open and remain so and the most strange symptom of all be that you get yourself wish to go blind and deaf no small feat for such a sort of a movie the only word that come to my mind just have finish my ordeal be outrage  n  for a film make in senegal base i guess loosely on carmen the book by prosper merimee this film doesnt achieve a mere resemblance of the story that have be make famous a an opera and a other films ms gai a the karmen of the title be very good to look at her fiery dancing smolder the screen a be the case with her torrid love scene at the beginning of the film this be a karmen that aim to please to all gender but a real carmen she be not we would like to see ms  gai in other film in which her talent be well use than here  n  this be a very noir kind of episode it begin with jim return from a weekend trip with a new girlfriend the recently divorce karen mill pat delaneydaughter in law of john huston who know a few thing about noir film and her daughter when they arrive karen go in the house while jim pick up her daughter from the back seat and carry her up to her room he then discover karen have disappear without a trace of course he call dennis and when the police arrive they see no sign of karen but find her next door neighbor murder in the bush so of course that make jim an immediate suspect this be a great little mystery and the first half of the story be show by rocky ask jim to go over the story once again rocky suggests that by jim tell him the story he might remember a little detail that he didnt think be important at the time but now might lead to a clue a to what happen it a really well write scene and complete the transition of the rocky character from a grifter to a concerned parent it also go a long way to show that rocky isnt just some clueless old man either a he say you come to me because im your father and im smart than you this be one of those time where we see where jim get his smarts this episode also feature an appearance by hottie lara parker who play angelique in the dark shadow series and go on to play laura banner bruce wife in the incredible hulk series a few year later she look terrific here this episode also mark the first mention of the minette crime family a name that would keep pop up on the rockford file almost whenever they need a mob family this time it vincent minette who rockford help apprehend lt diehl tom atkins make his first appearance on the series and dennis be quietly demote from a police lieutenant that he be on the early season one episodes to a police sargent i guess they figure it would be good to have dennis less powerful and add some conflict between jim and the police frankly they be right though i prefer the late lt  chapman to lt  diehl not a lot of the typical rockford humor in this episode but a good mystery with a lot of heart  n  the royal rumble have traditionally be one of my favourite event and ive be a wrestling fan for a good few year now the other show may have good match but ive always find the actual rumble match to be full of excitement im not go to reveal the winner of any match a i dont see it a fair to ruin the result on a review i will comment on the quality of them though we have the standard match and then the big rumble event two from smackdown and two from raw shawn michael and edge open up for raw this prove to be a good match from two talented guy this be a match id recommend watch it hard to sum up without give away the winner next we have the usual undertaker against some big nasty monster be whoever it be giant gonzales yokozuna kamala     well this time it heidenreich it also a casket match typical undertaker fare watch if youre a fan i have to admit i be purely for the entertainment factor it can hardly be regard a a classic wrestling match the next two match be the title match for once smackdown manages to upstage raw their title match be pretty thrill and enjoyable but with a anticlimax and let down to end it raws match be a pretty dull and boring affair which be a pity a im a fan of both guy involved now to the main reason i love the event the rumble it a pretty good one this year come up to the event we all have a pretty good idea of who might win and it may not prove a big surprise but hey it very enjoyable there be the usual diverse way of people be eliminate there be the token guy who doesnt make it to the ring the entrant who be ridiculous and we all want to see vanquished and someone get eliminate by a previously eliminate combatant it have it usual high and low and i love the end in particular the vince mcmahon entrance id recommend this show not the wwe on top form but it still good add it to your collection  n  i remember this in a similar vein to the young one wed stumble back from the pub and watch this or tape it and then spend week replay the line to each other we call one of our mate zipmole watkins after the illiant episode in which daniel peacock have a bit of restyling on his nose by the back street abortionist lots of great line remember at in the morning you can only get white ead from a own man take it easy guy gandhi a a local shopkeeper tony woodcock be definitely on there in the episode they be teach ralph daniel peacock to be a barman it no good amanda ill never make it a a bar man helen lederer teach him to ask people about the match see the match last night i think woodcock play well after a string of failed conversation the curly haired arsenal star be sit at the bar see the match last night yeah i think i play wellwe still do odd stupid line now reg and ralph        or         ralph and reg reg reg     reg reg reg reglots of very surreal silly moment and very surreal song from the flatlet the back street abortionist a personal favourite with the great end line and hell mark your package return to sendergood old danny peacock you add a lot to some young drinker evening sir   update i find a couple of episode on tape im go to upload the gandhi sketch to youtube     n  destine to be a classic before it be even conceptualize this game deserve all the recognition it deserve at a time when firstperson shooter like quake iii arena and unreal tournament be garner all the attention of computer gamers graphic adventure be a die eed with great pun and humour the curse of monkey island be a game that people of all age group would enjoy life can only improve after play the curse of monkey island  prediction  the sequel escape from monkey island be already destine to be a classic too i guarantee it  n  stephane audran be the eponymous heroine of this beautifully measure study of a small danish community towards the end of the last century two beautiful and musically talented sister giveup their own prospect of happiness and marriage in order to lookafter their age father one day a french woman babette come to work for them after some year she win the lottery and be determine to do something for the sister who have take her in her solution be to prepare an exquisite and sumptuous feast which change the life of all those invite this be a film about human and cultural interaction reflect in the changing language of the dialogue from danish to french and especially between the dutiful soiety of protestant northern europe and the sensuousness of the catholic south it be also about human need and how warmth and kindness can be express and stimulate through the cultivation of the sens a profoundly uplifting film  n  this movie be way overhyped a lot of the viewer who think this be amaze must have be into the old school movie cause the whole movie be set in the past at first i think the movie be just show something from the past so i be expect that fade dreamy like light on the character to pass but it just go basically this be a movie try to mix the future with the past and the dont mix very well in this movie even with special effect you could actually see the blue screen the actor be work with there be too many movie out there that do exactly what this movie do so there be no reason for critic to hype this movie up say it the great movie ever do it just crap on a stick it also didnt help that the story line be sooo crappy i dont understand why hollywood agree to have this movie produce and i also dont understand how actors actresses in this movie be willing to be in a movie like this it almost a though everybody read the script and forget to read the fine print     it will all be do on a computer this be a movie that should have be on a movie network because nothing about this movie be revolutionary im very upset with myself for pay money to see this whatever you do dont waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow  n  it be incredible that there be two film with the same story release in this one come out a day before that other one with tom cruise didnt they do that with truman capote the same year and the zodiac killer last year interesting writer director david michael latt didnt have steven spielbergs budget and c  thomas howell be not tom cruise this be a pale imitation of the blockbuster that gross million worldwide the action be minimal and most of the time we be treat to the whining of rhett giles who play a pastor that be give up on his god gary busey be creepy a an army lt  n  i dunno sometimes     you try and try and try to be charitable towards all the b thru z grade movie out there but once in a while a particular movie just test your patience until you want to slap everyone involve bat people which i saw under the title it live by night be just such a movie you cant watch this without think that it really should have be an episode on night gallery and not one of the good one either the movie have something to do with a doctor who get bite by a bat and consequently start to morph into a werebat who drink human blood actually youd think if he be turn into a real bat hed be eat mosquito by the gallon bucket but because this be a cheap lurid horror movie blood the word in spite of the fact that he have grandmal seizure at the drop of a hat and blackout episode almost every night his friend and fellow physician dr  mustache aspenextreme insist that he just have an allergic reaction to the rabies shots meanwhile the world most obnoxious and stereotype county sheriff suspect the doc of be responsible for the utal murder and exsanguination of several local girl and one wino also meanwhile the doctor wife decide that denial be a river in egypt and alternately patronize him and nag him to distraction it not so much that the acting be bad you can tell that the actor be make professional level choice and be try to ing some juice and life to the script even the guy who play the sheriff okay it be pretty bad but it bad in a clich  d wooden professional way it just that everything about the act the way the scene be pace the costume the dialog the script and the story line in general set your teeth on edge and make you want to well slap everyone involved i think the movie have an outside chance at be a spooky unsettling little cult favorite but the director need to beat michael pataki an experienced character actor with a chair until pataki agree to act and not just channel dennis weaver he also need to find a script that make a little more sense with regard to the whole bat bite human who then turn into a bat scenario he also need the actor who play the doctor to find a little more physically believable bit of stage business for his episode instead of resort to man have a seizure page from the little golden book of clich  d act mannerism he need to rework the whole wife character make her both more intelligent less shrill and waaaaay more observant i would never voluntarily watch this film again except with the help of mike and the bot it bad but it isnt bad in a silly humorous or interesting way still well than battlefield earth or waterworld though  n  big fat liar be what you get when you combine terrific write great production and an emphasis on clever idea over adolescent pap the two star work great together andwhat can i say amanda bynes shine put irkel and lee major in the film be illiant touch watch this film with your kid if you dont laugh throughout it you must not have be pay attention  n  tim robbins and john cusack be two actor i have appreciate throughout their career and that be the only reason for choose to watch this movie well all i can say be i totally regret it these two great actor humiliate themselves all the way through by perform a number of irrelevant unimaginative and kitch to the extreme not that this be bad on it own sketch that be suppose to make people laugh but fail to do so the only reason i can think be that the director be their friend and they decide to support his movie by star in iti cant think of anything else because this movie be so cheap fortunately tim robbins and john cusack havent disappoint me ever since i would recommend you to avoid this film unless you want your opinion about the two actor spoil  n  on watch this film i be amaze at how medium perception can mould a person opinion of a celeity karen carpenter be a carefree but very unconfident young lady whose wonderful voice help her and her other richard to soar the chart with wonderful song a with all celeities of today they be often criticise about their music as well a their look style etc this have a huge effect on karen who rag a battle against her eating and drastically lose weight which eventually cause her death this heart felt film be not initially something which i would have think of watch but on start to view it then i be hook in the same way that the tina turner story do then this film enlighten you and allow you to see into the young performer life the acting be superb and even after nearly year after it be make then the directional and the dialogue be still entertaining i would recommend this to anyone who hasnt yet watch it it be amazingly accurate and emotionally charge  n  nothing be sacred just ask ernie fosselius these day everybody have a video camera and a movie be hardly out before the spoofs start fly quickly write and shot and often post directly to the internet spoof be hot these day and we go out of our way to make sure filmmaker dont get off on their own selfimportance year ago when the first star war be make it be a different world filmmaking be the playground of a select few and spoof be very rare then god give u hardware war it be shoot to look cheap or be it just cheap and the audio be obviously record after the fact do that take away from the experience heck no thats what make it so great it be raw and unpolished and hit relentlessly on some of the more pretentious moment of the original movie from fluke starbucker wave around a flashlight instead of a lightsaber i do that when i be young to chewchilla the wookie monster to auggie ben doggy nah just a little headache remark this film short be as much a part of the phenomenon a any of the actual star war film rent it buy it borrow it from a friend and may the farce be with you always  n  i hat it i hate selfaware pretentious inanity that masquerade a art this film be either stupidly inane or inanely stupid after the first half hour i fastfowarded through the dvd version and saw the same juvenile shennanigans over and over and over i become angered that i have spend hardearned money for sophomoric claptrap tint drivel in sepia or blue do not make something a movie let alone art  n  i usually try to be professional and constructive when i criticize movie but my god this be the bad movie i have ever see bad act bad effect bad script bad everything the plot follow a group of teen cliche on their way to a rave that take place in oad daylight at a remote island however when the group arrive all they find be an empty dance floor and bloody clothes determine to find out what happen to the rest of the partygoer the clan set off on a mission through a zombieinfested forest during this crusade they be aid by a police chick and a sea captain that just happen to have the right number of weapon to give to each of the kid they also meet up with jonathan cherry and some other survivor basically the rest of the movie be a collection of poorly direct action sequence include a far too long shootout outside of the house of the dead this fight come complete with cheesy hollywood violence redundant clip from the hotd video game and sloppy matrixesque camera rotations one of the character even volunteer to sacrifice himself to save the others why not because he be noble and ave but because part of his face get scar by acid a zombie spat on him after he continue to beat the creature long after it have be disable im suppose to feel sorry for this guy to sum it all up there be absolutely no point in see this movie unless you want to see for yourself just how terrible it be the theater i be in be more dead than the zombie on the screen and im sure the money i waste see this piece of sh t could easily cover the cost it take to make it grade f  n  if you like me be go to see this in a film history class or something like that at your school try to convince your teacher to see something else believe me anything be good than this movie it be slow pace confuse bore poorly construct gory gringy do i need to go on it message be good but i have see them be handle well in several other film the act isnt even any good this movie be just even more awkward a it start off a be funny not intensional though because of it surreal story than at the end just become uncomfortable to watch i honestly feel like hour and minute of my life have be rob why would anyone want to watch a girl describe a threesome for minute than watch them drive through a traffic jam for minute listen to a hippie who can make sheep appear witness a sort of rape than see the female lead role eat her husband honestly this movie deserve nothing but a and if your not happy with my previewseriously im an open mind guy and i like movie that protest through symbolism but this movie be just awful make any excuse you can to avoid this film  n  this be like a zoology textbook give that it depiction of animal be so accurate however here be a few detail that appear to have be slightly modify during the transition to film handgun bullet never hit giant komodo dragon it doesnt matter how many time you shoot at the komodo bullet just wont go near it the best way to avoid be eat by a giant coa or a giant komodo dragon be just to stand there the exception to this rule be if youve be tell to stay very still in which case you should run off until the komodo be right next to you and then you should stand there expect defeat minute of choppy slow motion footage behind the credit really make for enjoyable watching be a memory enhancement tool and an ample substitute for lose your boat license getting arrested member of elite army unit dont see giant komodo dragon come until they be within one metre of the oversized being maybe the computergenerated nature of these dragon have something to do with it when film a news story aim on expose illegal animal test a reporter and a cameraman with one camera be all the gear and personnel you will need sound gear a second camera microphone etc be all superfluous when you hear a loud animal scream and one person have a gun he should take it out and point it at the near person when you take a gun out the sound of the safety be take off will be make even if your finger be nowhere near the safety reporter agree to go halfway around the world in order to expose something without have the faint idea what theyre expose background research and vague knowledge be out of fashion in modern journalism handgun hold at least bullet in one clip and then more than that in the next clip despite that those with gun claim that they will need more ammo expensive camera also remember that the reporter only have one camera be regularly leave behind without even a moment hesitation or regret these camera amazingly manage to make their way back to the reporter all by themselves the blonde girl really be the stupid one the same girl that say not to go into a house because a komodo dragon can easily run right through it thus make it unsafe take a team into a building make of the same material for protection and nobody say a word about it hightech facility look like simple office with high school chemistry set geneticallymodified snake grow from normal size to foot long in a matter of a day but dont grow at all in the week either side the military routinely destroy entire island when people dont meet contact deadline men with gun dont necessarily change the direction theyre shoot when their target be no longer right in front of them instead they just keep shoot into the air the good look you be the great your chance of survive giant creature womens intuition be reliable enough to change even the most stubborn of mind any time youre be hunt by giant creature be a great time to hit on girl half your age animal noise be an appropriate masking noise for swear at the same volume old israeli and russian plane be regularly use by the u military    ',\n",

this julie andrews/blake edward opus i decide to purchase and watch it once and for all.boy what a terrible film it so bad and on so many level that i really do not know where to start in describe where and when it go so horribly wrong look at it now it obvious to any fan of movie that blake edward create this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other director have strike gold with andrew in musical mary poppins sound of music thoroughly modern millie etc but also because andrew be snub from star in project make famous on stage by julie herself camelot my fair lady etc because hollywood think she wasnt sexy or glamorous enough so blake create this stillborn effort to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy story/war movie/romance/slapstick comedy/musical darling lili suffers from multiple personality never know who or what it be some specific scene be good or effective but a a whole it just doesnt work at all to a point of it be very embarrassing.mind you the version on the dvd be the director cut or in this case let salvage whatever we can from this notorious box office flop in release the dvd edward cut scene from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version the film move along with no idea of what it be we be minute into it and we still dont know whats go on or why be watch whats go what kind of spy be lili how powerful be she be she ever responsible for someone death instead we watch a thoroughly bore look rock hudson try to woo a thoroughly bore look julie andrew thing arent help much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love why do julie fall for hudson why him and not other men she get involve with there should have be one of her ex hang around try to win her back or try to decipher her secret this would have give u some much need contrast to the muddle action it would also have give u some impetuous to the sluggish proceeding theres no catalyst in this story.one only have to look at the cut scene to clearly see that edward and the writer just come up with idea inspire by andrew and edward previous successes the best or bad example be the scene when andrew and hudson follow a group of child who sing in the middle of a forest edward channel sound of music it no wonder he remove it from the dvd back in that scene might have work on a certain level but today that moment reek of desperation there be other plot element directly inspire by andrews/edwards other film the endless scene of dogfight be inspire by the much good modern millie the musical moment ill give you three guess be create just to make fun of july mary poppins persona which be turn raunchy with julie do a striptease in the act the end bird eye view of julie run towards hudson plane be another wink at sound of music.the whole thing be confuse julie play a singer bear from a german father and british mother who live in england but sing her english song in paris you never know exactly where the story take place some moment be just badly edit like when julie and her uncle be on horseback they talk and talk and then julie suddenly sprint off in midsentence im like what happen here the comedy bit be unfunny and cringeworthy every scene with the french police be pathetic wheres peter seller when you really need him the action be stupid beyond belief when julie and her uncle be on their way to germany on that train hudson squadron shoots round of bullet at the train almost kill lili in the process brilliant whats also funny about that scene be the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning thats one slow move train there the musical moment the beginning be the best part of the entire film and the reason i give this film star but it effect be diminish considerably because it repeat at the end speaking of redundant do we really need to see a cancan dance crepe suzette strip scene and julie strip too the girl in no man land be ok even if it bleeding obvious but that moment just doesnt make any sense whatsoever because lili sings it to a group of injured soldier at a french hospital make me wonder how many soldier there be injure indirectly by the result of her spy the whole project be listless and without energy the romance be unbelievable rock hudson be way too old and tire look check out the museum scene julie look daze like shes on valium but what really kill this illconceived project be julie play a german spy edward desperately want to dispel the mary poppins syndrome afflict his wife and believe that play a traitor be a good career decision as much a i like julie shes no greta garbo who pull it off so beautifully in mata hari funny enough even if julie play a german spy she still come across a cloying and cute.how bad be darling lili even after year since it release blake edward felt he still need to work on it for it dvd release\n"

      "such a joyous world have be create for u in pixars a bug life be immerse in a universe which could only be document this enjoyably on film but more precisely a universe which could only be document through the world of animation for those who have forget what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer Ã¢â€“ when it in the right hand that be Ã¢â€“ a bugs life be a warm reminder we walk out of the film with an equallywarm feeling and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only highcalie film productions.it be only pixars second animate feature the subgroup of disney make their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three year prior in with their landmark movie toy story it be a movie which defy convention reinvent and eathed new life into animation and define a whole new level of excellence now they return with their sophomore effort which to be honest draw a creep sense of cynicism in u all prior to see the film.after all it a film about ant well all walk of the insect and bug world be cover in a bugs life but it be the ant which be the focal point in this film a human be the focal point in drama romance and so on how can such an insignificant specie of animal such a an ant act a the protagonist of a movie let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film surely they jest however we forget that in toy story a bunch of toybox item be able to become the grand most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated hero and villain ever concoct the guy at pixar manage to pull off the same feat and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bug into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin youll probably ever encounter.not only be they all entirely amiable and likable Ã¢â€“ there isnt an unpleasant character in sight even the villain be rivet character Ã¢â€“ but theyre colourful theyre eclectic and theyre idiosyncratic and the array of character be also gargantuan for lack of a good term only add the rich layer of distinctiveness already plaster onto a bugs life from the beginning we shall start with our main character and our hero his name be flik david foley and his character be rather generic to say the least out of the thousand of faithful and obedient worker ant reside on the lush beautiful ant island he be the one consider the black sheep of the clan a see in the opening moment of the movie when he inadvertently destroy the season harvest with his antics.the problem arise in the fact that the ant harvest be for a bunch of greedy grasshopper lead by hopper kevin spacey who be eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ant when they show up to ant island for their annual banquet and see that their offering be go they go insane for lack of a good term hopper offer a proposition to save the ant from total extinction at his pack hand however it a negotiation which be simply impossible to fulfil the cog and clockwork in fliks mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame and he offer to leave ant island in search of some mighty bug warrior who can come to the colony rescue and fight off hopper and the grasshoppers.if you think about it a bugs life bear some heavy resemblance to the plot line of akira kurosawa classic seven samurai or the american remake the magnificent seven in which a village of hapless but goodhearted folk be threaten by malevolent and wicked enemy Ã¢â€“ one lone villagedweller go in search for help in the big city find it and return to the colony to drive off evil in a bugs life the help come in the form of a downandout circus troupe who be mistakenly perceive by flik a warrior in a barroom awl.much amusement come out of these scene and much amusement come out of these circus troupe bug among them be an erudite stick insect david hyde pierce a sidesplitting obese german caterpillar by the name of heimlich and a quasifemme fatale ladybug who in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug dennis hopper it exceedingly enjoyable watch these bug onscreen a it be watch the bug and the insect interact onscreen a be the entire movie collectively.as ive say much amusement and mirth come out of their character and joyous interaction with one another which give way to a bevy of hilarious line wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situation and overall a dazzling movie what make a bugs life even well be that the film isnt restrict simply to child a many may perceive it to be although child would indeed find more entertainment out of this film Ã¢â€“ the clichÃ£Â©d kidfriendly situation be a bit more abundant than wed like however it easy to ignore this fault and it incredulously easy to enjoy this film.although a bugs life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standard set by it predecessor this be still a superb movie and the start of something promising here pixar have prove that theyre not just a onehit wonder but instead a muchgifted and talented group of film artist in hollywood they raise the bar endlessly and when someone always manage to top their standard it only always by themselves what more be there to say about a bug life other than see it it not quite the best which weve see from the folk at emeryville california but this beat out the lot of it year Ã¢â€“ and ill be damn if this isnt the best animated feature of ../\n"

      "first let me just comment on what i like about the movie the special effect be fantastic and very rarely do i feel like i be watch a video game there that be the last nice thing i have to say about this film in fact i would just like everyone read this to take note that i cant even put into word how hard it be for me to write this review without swear i have innumerable complaint about the film but four major complaint jump to mind my first major complaint have to do with the incredible cheesiness of the plot twist if you can call it that since most people probably saw it come a mile away where loiss yearold son turn out to be the superpowered child of superman when the cry superchild throw a piano at lexs henchman to save his mother i almost get up and leave the theater singer could have make a much good superman movie without resort to cheap gimmick like a seemingly fragile but latently superpowered illegitimate child it be day since i saw the movie and i still want to vomit my next major complaint have to do with the fact that superman lift a continent make out of kryptonite up into out space it doesnt take comic book guy from the simpson to point out whats wrong with that i dont know how many comic book brian singer have read but when superman be expose to even a small amount of kryptonite he barely have the strength to stay on his foot whoever have the idea to have him fly a large island make out of his great weakness into space have no business be associate with any supermanrelated project ever again the concept be as ridiculous a make a dracula movie where the title character have a stake through his heart and still manage to fly a spaceship make out of garlic into the sun why not just have superman eat kryptonite he can eat it and then ush his teeth with it and then go to sleep in kryptonite pajama thats not any more absurd then have him hoist a continent of kryptonite into space and then fall powerless through the atmosphere without burn up in reentry or splatter all over central park when he hit the ground my third major complaint have to do with the fact that singer slap moviegoer across the face with religious symbolism the entire movie i have to take issue with his characterization of superman a the only son of a godlike jorel send to earth to be a savior jorel wasnt allwise he be just a scientist and he didnt send his son to earth to be a savior he throw him in a rocket and hurriedly fire it into space because his planet be about to explode ill buy the christ allegory if brian singer can show me the part in the bible where god send christ to earth because heaven be about to explode and then radioactive piece of heaven become christ primary weakness furthermore the crucifixion scene where luthor stab superman in the side with a kryptonite spear just make me want to slam my face into a ick until im too aindead to notice the azenly obvious and inappropriate symbolism that will be taint the man of steel for the foreseeable future they might as well rename this movie superman return the passion of the christ.and speaking of luthor my last major complaint have to do with singer depiction of lex luthor lex luthor be a shrewd coldhearted business tycoon who be more apt to run for president which he do in the comic than try to destroy the world the man want money and power he want to be in charge not wreck everything yet the luthor we see superman return as well a all the previous superman movie be a wacky theatrical dunce who come up with zany scheme to destroy the world if singer have the slight loyalty to the character instead of the quite awful previous superman movie this film might not be such an unbearable travesty maybe singer next project can be a batman movie where he focus on the interpretation of batman from s tv show zam whap pow to summarize i dont know what i hate more the movie itself or the fact that so many people seem to be give it good review everyone be entitle to their opinion but if you dont hate this movie then your opinion be wrong i sincerely encourage anyone who read this not to see this movie if you havent already dont see it dont buy it when it come out on dvd dont rent it ... basically dont contribute any money towards it in any way this movie do not deserve to make any money in fact i think that for every person that see this movie bryan singer should be fin billion dollar if youre a superman fan and you really want to see this movie just bend over and have someone kick you in the ball and youll get the same experience without have to waste hour of your time\n",

      "i think that rotj be clearly the best out of the three star war movie i find it surprising that rotj be consider the weak installment in the trilogy by many who have vote to me it seem like rotj be the best because it have the most profound plot the most suspense surprise most emotional especially the end and definitely the most episodic movie i personally like the empire strike back a lot also but i think it be slightly less good than than rotj since it be slowermoving be not a episodic and i just do not feel as much suspense or emotion a i do with the third movie.it also seem like to me that after read these surprising review that the reason people cite for rotj be an inferior film to the other two be just plain ludicrous and be insignificant reason compare to the sheer excellence of the film a a whole i have hear many strange reason such a a because yoda die b because bobba fett die c because small ewoks defeat a band of stormtroopers d because darth vader be revealedi would like to debunk each of these reason because i believe that they miss the point completely first off who care if bobba fett die if george lucas want him to die then he want him to die dont get me wrong i be fan of bobba fett but he make a few cameo appearance and it be not lucas intention to make him a central character in the film that star war fan make him out to be his name be not even mention anywhere in the movie ... you have to go to the credit to find out bobba fetts name judge rotj because a minor character die be a bit much i think ... secondly many fan do not like yoda die sure it be a momentous period in the movie i be not happy to see him die either but it make the movie more realistic all the good guy cant stay alive in a realistic movie you know otherwise if all the good guy live and all the bad guy die this movie would have be tantamount to a cheesy saturday morning cartoon another aspect to this point about people not like yodas death.. well nobody complain when darth vader strike down obi wan kenobi in a new hope many consider a new hope to be the best of the trilogy why be obi wan death okay but yodas not ... hmmmmmmmmmmmm ... another reason i just can not believe be even state be because people find cute ewoks overpower stormtroopers to be impossible that be utterly ridiculous i can not believe this one first off the ewoks be in their native planet endor so they be cognizant of their home terrain since they live there if you watch the movie carefully many of the tactic the ewoks use in defeat the stormtroopers be through excellent use of their home field advantage since you live in the forest all your life i hope you would have learn to use it to your advantage they have swing vine rope log set up to trip those walker and other trap the stormtroopers be highly disadvantage because they be outnumber and not aware of the advantage of the forest the only thing they have be their blaster to add it be not like the ewoks be battle the stormtroopers themselves they be heavily assist by the band of rebel in that conquest i think that if the stormtroopers be to have defeat a combination of the star war heros the band of rebel as well a the huge clan of ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain that would have be a great upset lastly if this scene be still unbelievable to you.. how about in empire strike back or in a new hope where there be several scene of a group consist of just han solo chewbacca and the princess be shoot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blaster miss while the hero be in full view and not only that the hero of course always hit the stormtroopers with their blaster the trooper must have very very bad aim then at least in empire strike back the battle of endor be much more believable since you have two army pit each other not hero against a legion of stormtroopers dont believe me check out the battle at cloud city when our hero be escape landos base or when our hero be rescue princess leia and be shoot at somehow they miss a han solo and luke be try to exit the death star.the last reason that i care to discuss others be just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here be that people do not like darth vader be reveal well in many way that be a major part of the plot in the movie luke be try to find whether or not darth vader be his father annakin skywalker it would have be disappoint if the movie have end without luke get to see his father face because it make it complete by annakins revelation it symbolize the transition darth vader underwent from be possess by the dark side in his helmet and to the good person he be annakin skywalker by remove the helmet the point be that annakin die convert to the light side again and that be what the meaning of the helmet removal scene be about in fact thats be what i would have do in that scene too if i be luke father ... isnt that what you would have do if you want to see your son with your own eye before you die and not in a mechanized helmet on another note i think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people be that the sequel must be bad even if it be well that precede movie be another reason that rotj do not get a many accolade a it deserve i never go into a film with that deception in mind i always try to go into a film with the attitude that well it might be good or bad that the original .. but i can not know for sure.. let see that way i go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into think that a clearly superior film be not as good a it really was.i be not sure who criticize these movie but i have ask many college student and adult about which be their favorite star war movie and they all tell me except for one person that say that a new hope be their favorite that it be rotj i believe that the result on these poll be appal and quite misleading.bottom line the return of the jedi be the best of the trilogy this movie be the only one of the three that keep me rivet all throughout it minute there be not a moment of boredom because each scene be either suspenseful excite surprising or all of the above for example the emotional light saber battle between luke and his father in rotj be good than the one in the empire strike back any day finally i hope people go see the phantom menace with an open mind because if fan start look for nitpicky insignificant detail or see it as just another sequel to trash the movie such a this movie stink because luke be not in it then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like rotj suffer unfortunately\n"

      "although promote a one of the most sincere turkish film with an amateur cast icecream i scream be more like a caricature of sincerity.the plot open with the dream of ali a travel icecream salesman in a western anatolia town in which he see himself become successful use the same marketing method of big icecream company he dream of play in his product tv commercial with beautiful model in bikini dance around him a his dream turn into a nightmare he wake up with a big erection next to his gargantuan wife who reject to make sex with him for year with no apparent reason be it because he be not successful in his job apparently because he say he be sell well in the old day when there be no pressure from global icecream company but this be what he say we actually dont see him suffer that much he still sell good travel the neighboring village while his apprentice stay at the shop sell icecream to the people in the town ali blame big company for use sweetening and color agent while he be use real sahlep powder root of mountain orchid ali buy a motorbike with a bank loan to be a travel vendor and give ad to a local tv channel which prefers to oadcast even the news bulletin in local dialect his wife be not fond of his way of do business they always quarrel and ali threaten her that he may do very bad thing in a moment of frenzy.in a very successful day his lousy bike be steal by the misbehaving little boy of the town in search of his steal bike ali go to the police blame the big company for the theft but of course nobody take him seriously annoy by the nagging of his wife ali go to a tavern and become drunk one of his friend at his table a wannabe socialist of the town give a didactic speech and criticize globalism and with no real connection jump to the subject of global freezing ali return home and decides to kill himself with poison his wife wake up and prevents him an old neighbor take him to a night walk and advise him about life accord to him ali can even sell hot sahlep drink if the world face with global freezing when he return home suddenly we see that his wife understand his value treat him like a hero and praise his manhood meanwhile the thief boys get sick eat too much icecream they confess to the doctor that they steal ali bike ali forgives them and there come the happy end.although the plot may look promise in a way it the storytelling which make this film insincere and cheesy first the director doesnt show much of an effort to tell the story visually everything be base on dialog and the dialog never stop to show u that cinema be actually a visual art even alis trouble be not convincing because we dont see it we just understand it from his word the director market his film a a righteous fight of ali against big icecream company but there be nothing in the film about big company we dont see their pressure enough the film actually ridicule ali for believe that big company be behind the theft and when his motorbike be find it solve every problem ali become a happy and powerful husband not a real criticism of globalism.second the film be cheesy because of the crude humor maybe the people of that part of turkey be curse so much and make so many vulgar joke in their daily life but vulgar language and crude humor be not enough to make a film funny i may have accept it if they be both vulgar and clever but they be not clever joke at all they be just cheesy maybe im wrong maybe american people may like oriental version of american pie style humor but american pie never have any claim to be a nominee for the oscar or to have a political message if you think that you can laugh by just see a man big erection in his short and we have to endure this joke twice or an old villager woman say f**k you then you may find this film funny\n",

now this movie hold a special place in my heart already despite me be only year old at the time of write this review i because of my s style early childhood watch many tv show and saw many movie that other kid didnt see and this movie be one of those and one of the great too.it start off in the los angeles home of alvin seville simon seville theodore seville and david seville david the chipmunk adoptive father be in a rush to get to the airport a he be go on a business trip around europe his taxi be almost there and the chipmunk help him pack while they be talk alvin express his will to come with dave and to see the world even though technically dave be only go to europe so to alvin apparently only america and europe qualify a the world david be leave the chipmunk in the care of miss miller much to the displeasure of the boy soon dave be off to the airport and the chipmunk be leave at home with miss miller later at a local cafÃ£Â© the chipmunk be play a game of around the world in day against the chipettes brittany jeanette and eleanore after lose the game to brittany after have his hot air balloon eat out of the sky by a crocodile alvin get in an argument with brittany about who would really win a race around the world two diamond smuggler sit at a nearby table klaus and claudia furschtien overhear their argument and need a safe way of transport their diamond over the world decide to fool the child into deliver them for them they set up a race around the world where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness secretely fill with diamond at drop offs around the world and receive a doll in the oppose team likeness secretely fill with the payment for the diamond to varify that they be there the winning team would then receive a dollar reward they do this because they believe that jamal an interpol agent who have be hot on their heel for some time now would never suspect them because they be just kid however this seem to be redundant because on their travel the kid do not have to go through any security check and be never even question about the doll i suspect that neither would klaus or claudia if they have take the diamond there personally and so begin a great adventure this film be a classic and i see no reason why anyone would not like it it feature great animation and topnotch voice act not to mention the kickass music pardon my french p my favorite song be without a shred of doubt the girl and boy of rock and roll an amazing rock song that can not be top it also my favorite moment in the film other notable song include get lucky kind of suggestive for a kid film eh and my mother as well a wooly bully and off to see the world not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credit perform by the royal london philharmonic orchestra the scene with my mother still ings a tear to my eye in relation to the song get lucky i first didnt think anything of it but when i grow old and learn about life it become clear that that song be a little bit suggestive that song along with the fact that the animator insist on the audience know the color of the chipettes panty this be especially apparent in the scene in egypt when the chipettes be be chase by the arabian prince men when eleanor lean over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely while this do nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film it one of those unexplained thing like why nobody in the world seem to mind that there be foot tall chipmunk walk around and speak in incredibly highpitched voice and treat them just like they would any human child anyway a bit after that scene the chipettes discover the diamond in the doll and decide to go find the chipmunk and get home the direction of janice karman perfect this movie a she and her husband ross bagdasarian jr. know the character good than anyone they even do the voice of the chipmunk and the chipettes ross do the voice for alvin and simon as well a dave and janice do the voice for all the chipettes and theodore speaking of male character that be voice by female voice actress nancy cartwright the voice of bart simpson make an appearance in this movie she play the part of the arabian prince a very small but important role the end be of course a happy one the crook have be catch the loose end tie and the film end when the child dave and miss miller be drive into the sunset alvin complain about not have get his dollar reward for win the race which annoy dave until he finally yell alvin and the screen fade to blackclassic end by the way i hope you find my review of this movie useful and if you havent see this flick give it a watch it worth the money this nostalgic classic from the s get a solid out of headin for the top dont you know we never stop believing now\n"

      "although there be some snippet in this part documentary hint at the necessity for recreational drug law reform these be not very welldeveloped in contrast to the many snippet from those who feel that the drug that happen to currently be illegal be a scourge for which the only imaginable solution be incarceration of even those who be guilty even of mere possession of such drugs.although this program a a whole leave the viewer with the impression that the drug war be largely a futile exercise and a waste of money and for that it deserve some praise almost nothing in this documentary address the very real problem that total war against those who merely possess illegal drug obviously cause and contributes tovery real problem that most drug warrior themselves would tell you if ask they think the drug war be design to solve for example while many minute be spend on the surge in violence associate with the rise popularity of crack cocaine in the s at no point do this program even hint that the very law design to suppress crack cocaine make it impossible for drug seller to enforce their contract and business arrangement in court of law force them to resort to violence to stay in business but instead of see the law a an important cause of the violence the drug themselves seem to take the unt of the blame inexplicably alcohol prohibition the violence that ensue and the subsequent reversal of prohibition be totally ignore by this program.this program will help to perpetuate ridiculous stereotype of drug user and it be these that be the primary force in drive the very expensive and very problematic drug war the possibility of incorporate drug other than alcohol into a happy and successful life be not really touch on use of any drug in excess be probably go to cause personal problem but not all user do their drug in excess just like not all alcohol user be alcoholics.if you want a point of view from someone who believe that adult have a moral right not to be incarcerate and have their life ruin by the criminal justice system just for use drug that the government for mostly very arbitrary political reason rather than reason base on sound social policy and legitimate science have decide to totally prohibit whose user it have decide to notsometaphorically wage war against just forget about it none of that be in here.on the other hand this be hardly in the category of antidrug propaganda it be mostly an interesting neutrallypresented history of drug in th century united state like marijuana lsd heroin cocaine mdma and oxycontin but there be a significant element of various people point of view with regard to drug law and most but not all of that be not very thoughtful or wellinformed and slant in favor of the drug warrior mentality especially with respect to drug other than marijuana the criminal justice system along with it often harsh liferuining penalty be obviously not the only answer or the most appropriate answer to every single social problem but unfortunately theres an epidemic in this nation of an asyet unnamed disease whose primary symptom be a lack of imagination with respect to social policy when it come to certain drug a lack of compassion for fellow human a prejudice against people who use the drug that be not governmentallyapproved perhaps a vested interest in the growth of the prison/policing industry and a horrid apathy with regard to human dignity it morally wrong to kidnap or incarcerate people unless you have a very damn good reason for do so and the mere possession of an arbitrarily select group of drug be clearly not such a reason this be really the primary issue when it come to drug yet this program ignore it.so in sum the part of this program that neutrally present history without feed stereotype of drug user that be at the heart of the drug war mentality be pretty good and interesting and entertain but when it come to present a rational nonradical point of view with regard to drug policy and give the viewer examples not only of people with drug problem but also the many people who successfully incorporate drug into happy and successful live it pretty disappointing\n"
